    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are old Parisians who will tell you pompously that the boulevards,
      like the political cafes, have ceased to exist, but this means only that
      the boulevards no longer gossip of Louis Napoleon, the Return of the
      Bourbons, or of General Boulanger, for these highways are always too
      busily stirring with present movements not to be forgetful of their
      yesterdays. In the shade of the buildings and awnings, the loungers, the
      lookers-on in Paris, the audience of the boulevard, sit at little tables,
      sipping coffee from long glasses, drinking absinthe or bright-coloured
      sirops, and gazing over the heads of throngs afoot at others borne along
      through the sunshine of the street in carriages, in cabs, in glittering
      automobiles, or high on the tops of omnibuses.
    </p>
    <p>
      From all the continents the multitudes come to join in that procession:
      Americans, tagged with race-cards and intending hilarious disturbances;
      puzzled Americans, worn with guide-book plodding; Chinese princes in silk;
      queer Antillean dandies of swarthy origin and fortune; ruddy English,
      thinking of nothing; pallid English, with upper teeth bared and eyes
      hungrily searching for sign-boards of tea-rooms; over-Europeanised
      Japanese, unpleasantly immaculate; burnoosed sheiks from the desert, and
      red-fezzed Semitic peddlers; Italian nobles in English tweeds; Soudanese
      negroes swaggering in frock coats; slim Spaniards, squat Turks,
      travellers, idlers, exiles, fugitives, sportsmen&mdash;all the tribes and
      kinds of men are tributary here to the Parisian stream which, on a fair
      day in spring, already overflows the banks with its own much-mingled
      waters. Soberly clad burgesses, bearded, amiable, and in no fatal hurry;
      well-kept men of the world swirling by in miraculous limousines; legless
      cripples flopping on hands and leather pads; thin-whiskered students in
      velveteen; walrus-moustached veterans in broadcloth; keen-faced old
      prelates; shabby young priests; cavalrymen in casque and cuirass;
      workingmen turned horse and harnessed to carts; sidewalk jesters,
      itinerant vendors of questionable wares; shady loafers dressed to resemble
      gold-showering America; motor-cyclists in leather; hairy musicians, blue
      gendarmes, baggy red zouaves; purple-faced, glazed-hatted,
      scarlet-waistcoated, cigarette-smoking cabmen, calling one another &ldquo;onions,&rdquo;
      &ldquo;camels,&rdquo; and names even more terrible. Women prevalent over
      all the concourse; fair women, dark women, pretty women, gilded women,
      haughty women, indifferent women, friendly women, merry women. Fine women
      in fine clothes; rich women in fine clothes; poor women in fine clothes.
      Worldly old women, reclining befurred in electric landaulettes; wordy old
      women hoydenishly trundling carts full of flowers. Wonderful automobile
      women quick-glimpsed, in multiple veils of white and brown and sea-green.
      Women in rags and tags, and women draped, coifed, and befrilled in the
      delirium of maddened poet-milliners and the hasheesh dreams of ladies&rsquo;
      tailors.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the procession, as it moves interminably along the boulevard, a blue
      haze of fine dust and burnt gasoline rises into the sunshine like the haze
      over the passages to an amphitheatre toward which a crowd is trampling;
      and through this the multitudes seem to go as actors passing to their
      cues. Your place at one of the little tables upon the sidewalk is that of
      a wayside spectator: and as the performers go by, in some measure acting
      or looking their parts already, as if in preparation, you guess the roles
      they play, and name them comedians, tragedians, buffoons, saints,
      beauties, sots, knaves, gladiators, acrobats, dancers; for all of these
      are there, and you distinguish the principles from the unnumbered
      supernumeraries pressing forward to the entrances. So, if you sit at the
      little tables often enough&mdash;that is, if you become an amateur
      boulevardier&mdash;you begin to recognise the transient stars of the
      pageant, those to whom the boulevard allows a dubious and fugitive role of
      celebrity, and whom it greets with a slight flutter: the turning of heads,
      a murmur of comment, and the incredulous boulevard smile, which seems to
      say: &ldquo;You see? Madame and monsieur passing there&mdash;evidently
      they think we still believe in them!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This flutter heralded and followed the passing of a white touring-car with
      the procession one afternoon, just before the Grand Prix, though it needed
      no boulevard celebrity to make the man who lolled in the tonneau
      conspicuous. Simply for THAT, notoriety was superfluous; so were the
      remarkable size and power of his car; so was the elaborate touring-costume
      of flannels and pongee he wore; so was even the enamelled presence of the
      dancer who sat beside him. His face would have done it without
      accessories.
    </p>
    <p>
      My old friend, George Ward, and I had met for our aperitif at the Terrace
      Larue, by the Madeleine, when the white automobile came snaking its way
      craftily through the traffic. Turning in to pass a victoria on the wrong
      side, it was forced down to a snail&rsquo;s pace near the curb and not far
      from our table, where it paused, checked by a blockade at the next corner.
      I heard Ward utter a half-suppressed guttural of what I took to be
      amazement, and I did not wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The face of the man in the tonneau detached him to the spectator&rsquo;s
      gaze and singled him out of the concourse with an effect almost ludicrous
      in its incongruity. The hair was dark, lustrous and thick, the forehead
      broad and finely modelled, and certain other ruinous vestiges of youth and
      good looks remained; but whatever the features might once have shown of
      honour, worth, or kindly semblance had disappeared beyond all tracing in a
      blurred distortion. The lids of one eye were discoloured and swollen
      almost together; other traces of a recent battering were not lacking, nor
      was cosmetic evidence of a heroic struggle, on the part of some valet of
      infinite pains, to efface them. The nose lost outline in the
      discolorations of the puffed cheeks; the chin, tufted with a small
      imperial, trembled beneath a sagging, gray lip. And that this bruised and
      dissipated mask should suffer the final grotesque touch, it was decorated
      with the moustache of a coquettish marquis, the ends waxed and exquisitely
      elevated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure was fat, but loose and sprawling, seemingly without the will to
      hold itself together; in truth the man appeared to be almost in a
      semi-stupor, and, contrasted with this powdered Silenus, even the woman
      beside him gained something of human dignity. At least, she was thoroughly
      alive, bold, predatory, and in spite of the gross embon-point that
      threatened her, still savagely graceful. A purple veil, dotted with gold,
      floated about her hat, from which green-dyed ostrich plumes cascaded down
      across a cheek enamelled dead white. Her hair was plastered in blue-black
      waves, parted low on the forehead; her lips were splashed a startling
      carmine, the eyelids painted blue; and, from between lashes gummed into
      little spikes of blacking, she favoured her companion with a glance of
      carelessly simulated tenderness,&mdash;a look all too vividly suggesting
      the ghastly calculations of a cook wheedling a chicken nearer the kitchen
      door. But I felt no great pity for the victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; I asked, staring at the man in the automobile and
      not turning toward Ward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is Mariana&mdash;&lsquo;la bella Mariana la Mursiana,&rsquo;&rdquo;
      George answered; &ldquo;&mdash;one of those women who come to Paris from
      the tropics to form themselves on the legend of the one great famous and
      infamous Spanish dancer who died a long while ago. Mariana did very well
      for a time. I&rsquo;ve heard that the revolutionary societies intend
      striking medals in her honour: she&rsquo;s done worse things to royalty
      than all the anarchists in Europe! But her great days are over: she&rsquo;s
      getting old; that type goes to pieces quickly, once it begins to slump,
      and it won&rsquo;t be long before she&rsquo;ll be horribly fat, though she&rsquo;s
      still a graceful dancer. She danced at the Folie Rouge last week.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, George,&rdquo; I said gratefully. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll
      point out the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower to me some day. I didn&rsquo;t
      mean Mariana.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      What I had meant was so obvious that I turned to my friend in surprise. He
      was nervously tapping his chin with the handle of his cane and staring at
      the white automobile with very grim interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant the man with her,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; He laughed sourly. &ldquo;That carrion?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to be an acquaintance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody on the boulevard knows who he is,&rdquo; said Ward
      curtly, paused, and laughed again with very little mirth. &ldquo;So do
      you,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;and as for my acquaintance with him&mdash;yes,
      I had once the distinction of being his rival in a small way, a way so
      small, in fact, that it ended in his becoming a connection of mine by
      marriage. He&rsquo;s Larrabee Harman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That was a name somewhat familiar to readers of American newspapers even
      before its bearer was fairly out of college. The publicity it then
      attained (partly due to young Harman&rsquo;s conspicuous wealth) attached
      to some youthful exploits not without a certain wild humour. But frolic
      degenerated into brawl and debauch: what had been scrapes for the boy
      became scandals for the man; and he gathered a more and more unsavoury
      reputation until its like was not to be found outside a penitentiary. The
      crux of his career in his own country was reached during a midnight
      quarrel in Chicago when he shot a negro gambler. After that, the negro
      having recovered and the matter being somehow arranged so that the
      prosecution was dropped, Harman&rsquo;s wife left him, and the papers
      recorded her application for a divorce. She was George Ward&rsquo;s second
      cousin, the daughter of a Baltimore clergyman; a belle in a season and
      town of belles, and a delightful, headstrong creature, from all accounts.
      She had made a runaway match of it with Harman three years before, their
      affair having been earnestly opposed by all her relatives&mdash;especially
      by poor George, who came over to Paris just after the wedding in a
      miserable frame of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chicago exploit was by no means the end of Harman&rsquo;s notoriety.
      Evading an effort (on the part of an aunt, I believe) to get him locked up
      safely in a &ldquo;sanitarium,&rdquo; he began a trip round the world with
      an orgy which continued from San Francisco to Bangkok, where, in the
      company of some congenial fellow travellers, he interfered in a native
      ceremonial with the result that one of his companions was drowned.
      Proceeding, he was reported to be in serious trouble at Constantinople,
      the result of an inquisitiveness little appreciated by Orientals. The
      State Department, bestirring itself, saved him from a very real peril, and
      he continued his journey. In Rome he was rescued with difficulty from a
      street mob that unreasonably refused to accept intoxication as an excuse
      for his riding down a child on his way to the hunt. Later, during the
      winter just past, we had been hearing from Monte Carlo of his disastrous
      plunges at that most imbecile of all games, roulette.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every event, no matter how trifling, in this man&rsquo;s pitiful career
      had been recorded in the American newspapers with an elaboration which,
      for my part, I found infuriatingly tiresome. I have lived in Paris so long
      that I am afraid to go home: I have too little to show for my years of
      pottering with paint and canvas, and I have grown timid about all the
      changes that have crept in at home. I do not know the &ldquo;new men,&rdquo;
      I do not know how they would use me, and fear they might make no place for
      me; and so I fit myself more closely into the little grooves I have worn
      for myself, and resign myself to stay. But I am no &ldquo;expatriate.&rdquo;
      I know there is a feeling at home against us who remain over here to do
      our work, but in most instances it is a prejudice which springs from a
      misunderstanding. I think the quality of patriotism in those of us who
      &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t go home in time&rdquo; is almost pathetically deep and
      real, and, like many another oldish fellow in my position, I try to keep
      as close to things at home as I can. All of my old friends gradually
      ceased to write to me, but I still take three home newspapers, trying to
      follow the people I knew and the things that happen; and the ubiquity of
      so worthless a creature as Larrabee Harman in the columns I dredged for
      real news had long been a point of irritation to this present exile. Not
      only that: he had usurped space in the Continental papers, and of late my
      favourite Parisian journal had served him to me with my morning coffee,
      only hinting his name, but offering him with that gracious satire
      characteristic of the Gallic journalist writing of anything American. And
      so this grotesque wreck of a man was well known to the boulevard&mdash;one
      of its sights. That was to be perceived by the flutter he caused, by the
      turning of heads in his direction, and the low laughter of the people at
      the little tables. Three or four in the rear ranks had risen to their feet
      to get a better look at him and his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one behind us chuckled aloud. &ldquo;They say Mariana beats him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evidently!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The dancer was aware of the flutter, and called Harman&rsquo;s attention
      to it with a touch upon his arm and a laugh and a nod of her violent
      plumage.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that he seemed to rouse himself somewhat: his head rolled heavily over
      upon his shoulder, the lids lifted a little from the red-shot eyes,
      showing a strange pride when his gaze fell upon the many staring faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as the procession moved again and the white automobile with it, the
      sottish mouth widened in a smile of dull and cynical contempt: the look of
      a half-poisoned Augustan borne down through the crowds from the Palatine
      after supping with Caligula.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ward pulled my sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let us go over to the Luxembourg
      gardens where the air is cleaner.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ward is a portrait-painter, and in the matter of vogue there seem to be no
      pinnacles left for him to surmount. I think he has painted most of the
      very rich women of fashion who have come to Paris of late years, and he
      has become so prosperous, has such a polite celebrity, and his opinions
      upon art are so conclusively quoted, that the friendship of some of us who
      started with him has been dangerously strained.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lives a well-ordered life; he has always led that kind of life. Even in
      his student days when I first knew him, I do not remember an occasion upon
      which the principal of a New England high-school would have criticised his
      conduct. And yet I never heard anyone call him a prig; and, so far as I
      know, no one was ever so stupid as to think him one. He was a quiet,
      good-looking, well-dressed boy, and he matured into a somewhat reserved,
      well-poised man, of impressive distinction in appearance and manner. He
      has always been well tended and cared for by women; in his student days
      his mother lived with him; his sister, Miss Elizabeth, looks after him
      now. She came with him when he returned to Paris after his disappointment
      in the unfortunate Harman affair, and she took charge of all his business&mdash;as
      well as his social&mdash;arrangements (she has been accused of a theory
      that the two things may be happily combined), making him lease a house in
      an expensively modish quarter near the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne. Miss
      Elizabeth is an instinctively fashionable woman, practical withal, and to
      her mind success should be not only respectable but &ldquo;smart.&rdquo;
      She does not speak of the &ldquo;right bank&rdquo; and the &ldquo;left
      bank&rdquo; of the Seine; she calls them the &ldquo;right bank&rdquo; and
      the &ldquo;wrong bank.&rdquo; And yet, though she removed George (her word
      is &ldquo;rescued&rdquo;) from many of his old associations with
      Montparnasse, she warmly encouraged my friendship with him&mdash;yea, in
      spite of my living so deep in the wrong bank that the first time he
      brought her to my studio, she declared she hadn&rsquo;t seen anything so
      like Bring-the-child-to-the-old-hag&rsquo;s-cellar-at-midnight since her
      childhood. She is a handsome woman, large, and of a fine, high colour; her
      manner is gaily dictatorial, and she and I got along very well together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably she appreciated my going to some pains with the clothes I wore
      when I went to their house. My visits there were infrequent, not because I
      had any fear of wearing out a welcome, but on account of Miss Elizabeth&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;day,&rdquo; when I could see nothing of George for the crowd of
      lionising women and time-wasters about him. Her &ldquo;day&rdquo; was a
      dread of mine; I could seldom remember which day it was, and when I did
      she had a way of shifting it so that I was fatally sure to run into it&mdash;to
      my misery, for, beginning with those primordial indignities suffered in
      youth, when I was scrubbed with a handkerchief outside the parlour door as
      a preliminary to polite usages, my childhood&rsquo;s, manhood&rsquo;s
      prayer has been: From all such days, Good Lord, deliver me!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was George&rsquo;s habit to come much oftener to see me. He always
      really liked the sort of society his sister had brought about him; but now
      and then there were intervals when it wore on him a little, I think.
      Sometimes he came for me in his automobile and we would make a mild
      excursion to breakfast in the country; and that is what happened one
      morning about three weeks after the day when we had sought pure air in the
      Luxembourg gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      We drove out through the Bois and by Suresnes, striking into a roundabout
      road to Versailles beyond St. Cloud. It was June, a dustless and balmy
      noon, the air thinly gilded by a faint haze, and I know few things
      pleasanter than that road on a fair day of the early summer and no sweeter
      way to course it than in an open car; though I must not be giving myself
      out for a &ldquo;motorist&rdquo;&mdash;I have not even the right cap. I am
      usually nervous in big machines, too; but Ward has never caught the speed
      mania and holds a strange power over his chauffeur; so we rolled along
      peacefully, not madly, and smoked (like the car) in hasteless content.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; said George, with a placid wave of the hand,
      &ldquo;I sometimes wish that the landscape had called me. You outdoor men
      have all the health and pleasure of living in the open, and as for the
      work&mdash;oh! you fellows think you work, but you don&rsquo;t know what
      it means.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&rdquo; I said, and smiled as I always meanly do when George
      &ldquo;talks art.&rdquo; He was silent for a few moments and then said
      irritably,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, at least you can&rsquo;t deny that the academic crowd can
      DRAW!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Never having denied it, though he had challenged me in the same way
      perhaps a thousand times, I refused to deny it now; whereupon he returned
      to his theme: &ldquo;Landscape is about as simple as a stage fight; two
      up, two down, cross and repeat. Take that ahead of us. Could anything be
      simpler to paint?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He indicated the white road running before us between open fields to a
      curve, where it descended to pass beneath an old stone culvert. Beyond,
      stood a thick grove with a clear sky flickering among the branches. An old
      peasant woman was pushing a heavy cart round the curve, a scarlet
      handkerchief knotted about her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think it&rsquo;s easy?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easy! Two hours ought to do it as well as it could be done&mdash;at
      least, the way you fellows do it!&rdquo; He clenched his fingers as if
      upon the handle of a house-painter&rsquo;s brush. &ldquo;Slap, dash&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      your road.&rdquo; He paddled the air with the imaginary brush as though
      painting the side of a barn. &ldquo;Swish, swash&mdash;there go your
      fields and your stone bridge. Fit! Speck! And there&rsquo;s your old
      woman, her red handkerchief, and what your dealer will probably call
      &lsquo;the human interest,&rsquo; all complete. Squirt the edges of your
      foliage in with a blow-pipe. Throw a cup of tea over the whole, and there&rsquo;s
      your haze. Call it &lsquo;The Golden Road,&rsquo; or &lsquo;The Bath of
      Sunlight,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Quiet Noon.&rsquo; Then you&rsquo;ll probably
      get a criticism beginning, &lsquo;Few indeed have more intangibly detained
      upon canvas so poetic a quality of sentiment as this sterling landscapist,
      who in Number 136 has most ethereally expressed the profound silence of
      evening on an English moor. The solemn hush, the brooding quiet, the
      homeward ploughman&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was interrupted by an outrageous uproar, the grisly scream of a siren
      and the cannonade of a powerful exhaust, as a great white touring-car
      swung round us from behind at a speed that sickened me to see, and,
      snorting thunder, passed us &ldquo;as if we had been standing still.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It hurtled like a comet down the curve and we were instantly choking in
      its swirling tail of dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seventy miles an hour!&rdquo; gasped George, swabbing at his eyes.
      &ldquo;Those are the fellows that get into the pa&mdash;Oh, Lord! THERE
      they go!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Swinging out to pass us and then sweeping in upon the reverse curve to
      clear the narrow arch of the culvert were too much for the white car; and
      through the dust we saw it rock dangerously. In the middle of the road,
      ten feet from the culvert, the old woman struggled frantically to get her
      cart out of the way. The howl of the siren frightened her perhaps, for she
      lost her head and went to the wrong side. Then the shriek of the machine
      drowned the human scream as the automobile struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shock of contact was muffled. But the mass of machinery hoisted itself
      in the air as if it had a life of its own and had been stung into sudden
      madness. It was horrible to see, and so grotesque that a long-forgotten
      memory of my boyhood leaped instantaneously into my mind, a recollection
      of the evolutions performed by a Newfoundland dog that rooted under a
      board walk and found a hive of wild bees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great machine left the road for the fields on the right, reared, fell,
      leaped against the stone side of the culvert, apparently trying to climb
      it, stood straight on end, whirled backward in a half-somersault, crashed
      over on its side, flashed with flame and explosion, and lay hidden under a
      cloud of dust and smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ward&rsquo;s driver slammed down his accelerator, sent us spinning round
      the curve, and the next moment, throwing on his brakes, halted sharply at
      the culvert.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fabric of the road was so torn and distorted one might have thought a
      steam dredge had begun work there, but the fragments of wreckage were
      oddly isolated and inconspicuous. The peasant&rsquo;s cart, tossed into a
      clump of weeds, rested on its side, the spokes of a rimless wheel slowly
      revolving on the hub uppermost. Some tools were strewn in a semi-circular
      trail in the dust; a pair of smashed goggles crunched beneath my foot as I
      sprang out of Ward&rsquo;s car, and a big brass lamp had fallen in the
      middle of the road, crumpled like waste paper. Beside it lay a gold rouge
      box.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman had somehow saved herself&mdash;or perhaps her saint had
      helped her&mdash;for she was sitting in the grass by the roadside, wailing
      hysterically and quite unhurt. The body of a man lay in a heap beneath the
      stone archway, and from his clothes I guessed that he had been the driver
      of the white car. I say &ldquo;had been&rdquo; because there were reasons
      for needing no second glance to comprehend that the man was dead.
      Nevertheless, I knelt beside him and placed my hand upon his breast to see
      if his heart still beat. Afterward I concluded that I did this because I
      had seen it done upon the stage, or had read of it in stories; and even at
      the time I realised that it was a silly thing for me to be doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ward, meanwhile, proved more practical. He was dragging a woman out of the
      suffocating smoke and dust that shrouded the wreck, and after a moment I
      went to help him carry her into the fresh air, where George put his coat
      under her head. Her hat had been forced forward over her face and held
      there by the twisting of a system of veils she wore; and we had some
      difficulty in unravelling this; but she was very much alive, as a series
      of muffled imprecations testified, leading us to conclude that her
      sufferings were more profoundly of rage than of pain. Finally she pushed
      our hands angrily aside and completed the untanglement herself, revealing
      the scratched and smeared face of Mariana, the dancer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cornichon! Chameau! Fond du bain!&rdquo; she gasped, tears of anger
      starting from her eyes. She tried to rise before we could help her, but
      dropped back with a scream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the pain!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;That imbecile! If he has let
      me break my leg! A pretty dancer I should be! I hope he is killed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the singularities of motoring on the main-travelled roads near
      Paris is the prevalence of cars containing physicians and surgeons.
      Whether it be testimony to the opportunism, to the sporting proclivities,
      or to the prosperity of gentlemen of those professions, I do not know, but
      it is a fact that I have never heard of an accident (and in the season
      there is an accident every day) on one of these roads when a doctor in an
      automobile was not almost immediately a chance arrival, and fortunately
      our case offered no exception to this rule. Another automobile had already
      come up and the occupants were hastily alighting. Ward shouted to the
      foremost to go for a doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a doctor,&rdquo; the man answered, advancing and kneeling
      quickly by the dancer. &ldquo;And you&mdash;you may be of help yonder.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We turned toward the ruined car where Ward&rsquo;s driver was shouting for
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; called Ward as we ran toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;there is some one under the
      tonneau here!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The smoke had cleared a little, though a rivulet of burning gasoline ran
      from the wreck to a pool of flame it was feeding in the road. The front
      cushions and woodwork had caught fire and a couple of labourers, panting
      with the run across the fields, were vainly belabouring the flames with
      brushwood. From beneath the overturned tonneau projected the lower part of
      a man&rsquo;s leg, clad in a brown puttee and a russet shoe. Ward&rsquo;s
      driver had brought his tools; had jacked up the car as high as possible;
      but was still unable to release the imprisoned body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seized that foot and pulled with all my strength,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;and I cannot make him move one centimetre. It is necessary
      that as many people as possible lay hold of the car on the side away from
      the fire and all lift together. Yes,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;and very
      soon!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Some carters had come from the road and one of them lay full length on the
      ground peering beneath the wreck. &ldquo;It is the head of monsieur,&rdquo;
      explained this one; &ldquo;it is the head of monsieur which is fastened
      under there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, but you are wiser than Clemenceau!&rdquo; said the chauffeur.
      &ldquo;Get up, my ancient, and you there, with the brushwood, let the fire
      go for a moment and help, when I say the word. And you, monsieur,&rdquo;
      he turned to Ward, &ldquo;if you please, will you pull with me upon the
      ankle here at the right moment?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The carters, the labourers, the men from the other automobile, and I laid
      hold of the car together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then, messieurs, LIFT!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Stifled with the gasoline smoke, we obeyed. One or two hands were scorched
      and our eyes smarted blindingly, but we gave a mighty heave, and felt the
      car rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done!&rdquo; cried the chauffeur. &ldquo;Well done! But a
      little more! The smallest fraction&mdash;HA! It is finished, messieurs!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We staggered back, coughing and wiping our eyes. For a minute or two I
      could not see at all, and was busy with a handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ward laid his hand on my shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know who it is?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I could see again, I found that I was looking almost straight down
      into the upturned face of Larrabee Harman, and I cannot better express
      what this man had come to be, and what the degradation of his life had
      written upon him, than by saying that the dreadful thing I looked upon now
      was no more horrible a sight than the face I had seen, fresh from the
      valet and smiling in ugly pride at the starers, as he passed the terrace
      of Larue on the day before the Grand Prix.
    </p>
    <p>
      We helped to carry him to the doctor&rsquo;s car, and to lift the dancer
      into Ward&rsquo;s, and to get both of them out again at the hospital at
      Versailles, where they were taken. Then, with no need to ask each other if
      we should abandon our plan to breakfast in the country, we turned toward
      Paris, and rolled along almost to the barriers in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did it seem to you,&rdquo; said George finally, &ldquo;that a man
      so frightfully injured could have any chance of getting well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;I thought he was dying as we carried
      him into the hospital.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So did I. The top of his head seemed all crushed in&mdash;Whew!&rdquo;
      He broke off, shivering, and wiped his brow. After a pause he added
      thoughtfully, &ldquo;It will be a great thing for Louise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Louise was the name of his second cousin, the girl who had done battle
      with all her family and then run away from them to be Larrabee Harman&rsquo;s
      wife. Remembering the stir that her application for divorce had made, I
      did not understand how Harman&rsquo;s death could benefit her, unless
      George had some reason to believe that he had made a will in her favour.
      However, the remark had been made more to himself than to me and I did not
      respond.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning papers flared once more with the name of Larrabee Harman, and
      we read that there was &ldquo;no hope of his surviving.&rdquo; Ironic
      phrase! There was not a soul on earth that day who could have hoped for
      his recovery, or who&mdash;for his sake&mdash;cared two straws whether he
      lived or died. And the dancer had been right; one of her legs was badly
      broken: she would never dance again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evening papers reported that Harman was &ldquo;lingering.&rdquo; He was
      lingering the next day. He was lingering the next week, and the end of a
      month saw him still &ldquo;lingering.&rdquo; Then I went down to Capri,
      where&mdash;for he had been after all the merest episode to me&mdash;I was
      pleased to forget all about him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      A great many people keep their friends in mind by writing to them, but
      more do not; and Ward and I belong to the majority. After my departure
      from Paris I had but one missive from him, a short note, written at the
      request of his sister, asking me to be on the lookout for Italian
      earrings, to add to her collection of old jewels. So, from time to time, I
      sent her what I could find about Capri or in Naples, and she responded
      with neat little letters of acknowledgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two years I stayed on Capri, eating the lotus which grows on that happy
      island, and painting very little&mdash;only enough, indeed, to be
      remembered at the Salon and not so much as knowing how kindly or unkindly
      they hung my pictures there. But even on Capri, people sometimes hear the
      call of Paris and wish to be in that unending movement: to hear the
      multitudinous rumble, to watch the procession from a cafe terrace and to
      dine at Foyot&rsquo;s. So there came at last a fine day when I, knowing
      that the horse-chestnuts were in bloom along the Champs Elysees, threw my
      rope-soled shoes to a beggar, packed a rusty trunk, and was off for the
      banks of the Seine.
    </p>
    <p>
      My arrival&mdash;just the drive from the Gare de Lyon to my studio&mdash;was
      like the shock of surf on a bather&rsquo;s breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stir and life, the cheerful energy of the streets, put stir and life
      and cheerful energy into me. I felt the itch to work again, to be at it,
      at it in earnest&mdash;to lose no hour of daylight, and to paint better
      than I had painted!
    </p>
    <p>
      Paris having given me this impetus, I dared not tempt her further, nor
      allow the edge of my eagerness time to blunt; therefore, at the end of a
      fortnight, I went over into Normandy and deposited that rusty trunk of
      mine in a corner of the summer pavilion in the courtyard of Madame
      Brossard&rsquo;s inn, Les Trois Pigeons, in a woodland neighborhood that
      is there. Here I had painted through a prolific summer of my youth, and I
      was glad to find&mdash;as I had hoped&mdash;nothing changed; for the place
      was dear to me. Madame Brossard (dark, thin, demure as of yore, a
      fine-looking woman with a fine manner and much the flavour of old Norman
      portraits) gave me a pleasant welcome, remembering me readily but without
      surprise, while Amedee, the antique servitor, cackled over me and was as
      proud of my advent as if I had been a new egg and he had laid me. The
      simile is grotesque; but Amedee is the most henlike waiter in France.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is a white-haired, fat old fellow, always well-shaved; as neat as a
      billiard-ball. In the daytime, when he is partly porter, he wears a black
      tie, a gray waistcoat broadly striped with scarlet, and, from waist to
      feet, a white apron like a skirt, and so competently encircling that his
      trousers are of mere conventionality and no real necessity; but after six
      o&rsquo;clock (becoming altogether a maitre d&rsquo;hotel) he is clad as
      any other formal gentleman. At all times he wears a fresh table-cloth over
      his arm, keeping an exaggerated pile of them ready at hand on a ledge in
      one of the little bowers of the courtyard, so that he may never be shamed
      by getting caught without one.
    </p>
    <p>
      His conception of life is that all worthy persons were created as
      receptacles for food and drink; and five minutes after my arrival he had
      me seated (in spite of some meek protests) in a wicker chair with a
      pitcher of the right Three Pigeons cider on the table before me, while he
      subtly dictated what manner of dinner I should eat. For this interval
      Amedee&rsquo;s exuberance was sobered and his badinage dismissed as being
      mere garniture, the questions now before us concerning grave and inward
      matters. His suggestions were deferential but insistent; his manner was
      that of a prime minister who goes through the form of convincing the
      sovereign. He greeted each of his own decisions with a very loud &ldquo;Bien!&rdquo;
      as if startled by the brilliancy of my selections, and, the menu being
      concluded, exploded a whole volley of &ldquo;Biens&rdquo; and set off
      violently to instruct old Gaston, the cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is Amedee&rsquo;s way; he always starts violently for anywhere he
      means to go. He is a little lame and his progress more or less sidelong,
      but if you call him, or new guests arrive at the inn, or he receives an
      order from Madame Brossard, he gives the effect of running by a sudden
      movement of the whole body like that of a man ABOUT to run, and moves off
      using the gestures of a man who IS running; after which he proceeds to his
      destination at an exquisite leisure. Remembering this old habit of his, it
      was with joy that I noted his headlong departure. Some ten feet of his
      progress accomplished, he halted (for no purpose but to scratch his head
      the more luxuriously); next, strayed from the path to contemplate a
      rose-bush, and, selecting a leaf with careful deliberation, placed it in
      his mouth and continued meditatively upon his way to the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      I chuckled within me; it was good to be back at Madame Brossard&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      The courtyard was more a garden; bright with rows of flowers in formal
      little beds and blossoming up from big green tubs, from red jars, and also
      from two brightly painted wheel-barrows. A long arbour offered a shelter
      of vines for those who might choose to dine, breakfast, or lounge beneath,
      and, here and there among the shrubberies, you might come upon a latticed
      bower, thatched with straw. My own pavilion (half bedroom, half studio)
      was set in the midst of all and had a small porch of its own with a rich
      curtain of climbing honeysuckle for a screen from the rest of the
      courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inn itself is gray with age, the roof sagging pleasantly here and
      there; and an old wooden gallery runs the length of each wing, the
      guest-chambers of the upper story opening upon it like the deck-rooms of a
      steamer, with boxes of tulips and hyacinths along the gallery railings and
      window ledges for the gayest of border-lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond the great open archway, which gives entrance to the courtyard, lies
      the quiet country road; passing this, my eyes followed the wide sweep of
      poppy-sprinkled fields to a line of low green hills; and there was the
      edge of the forest sheltering those woodland interiors which I had long
      ago tried to paint, and where I should be at work to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of time, and well within the bright twilight, Amedee spread
      the crisp white cloth and served me at a table on my pavilion porch. He
      feigned anxiety lest I should find certain dishes (those which he knew
      were most delectable) not to my taste, but was obviously so distended with
      fatuous pride over the whole meal that it became a temptation to denounce
      at least some trifling sauce or garnishment; nevertheless, so much
      mendacity proved beyond me and I spared him and my own conscience. This
      puffed-uppedness of his was to be observed only in his expression of
      manner, for during the consumption of food it was his worthy custom to
      practise a ceremonious, nay, a reverential, hush, and he never offered (or
      approved) conversation until he had prepared the salad. That accomplished,
      however, and the water bubbling in the coffee machine, he readily favoured
      me with a discourse on the decline in glory of Les Trois Pigeons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, it is the automobiles; they have done it. Formerly, as
      when monsieur was here, the painters came from Paris. They would come in
      the spring and would stay until the autumn rains. What busy times and what
      drolleries! Ah, it was gay in those days! Monsieur remembers well. Ha, Ha!
      But now, I think, the automobiles have frightened away the painters; at
      least they do not come any more. And the automobiles themselves; they come
      sometimes for lunch, a few, but they love better the seashore, and we are
      just close enough to be too far away. Those automobiles, they love the big
      new hotels and the casinos with roulette. They eat hastily, gulp down a
      liqueur, and pouf! off they rush for Trouville, for Houlgate&mdash;for
      heaven knows where! And even the automobiles do not come so frequently as
      they did. Our road used to be the best from Lisieux to Beuzeval, but now
      the maps recommend another. They pass us by, and yet yonder&mdash;only a
      few kilometres&mdash;is the coast with its thousands. We are near the
      world but out of it, monsieur.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He poured my coffee; dropped a lump of sugar from the tongs with a
      benevolent gesture&mdash;&ldquo;One lump: always the same. Monsieur sees
      that I remember well, ha?&rdquo;&mdash;and the twilight having fallen, he
      lit two orange-shaded candles and my cigar with the same match. The night
      was so quiet that the candle-lights burned as steadily as flames in a
      globe, yet the air was spiced with a cool fragrance, and through the
      honeysuckle leaves above me I saw, as I leaned back in my wicker chair, a
      glimmer of kindly stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very comfortably out of the world, Amedee,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It
      seems to me I have it all to myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unhappily, yes!&rdquo; he exclaimed; then excused himself,
      chuckling. &ldquo;I should have said that we should be happier if we had
      many like monsieur. But it is early in the season to despair. Then, too,
      our best suite is already engaged.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By whom?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two men of science who arrive next week. One is a great man. Madame
      Brossard is pleased that he is coming to Les Trois Pigeons, but I tell her
      it is only natural. He comes now for the first time because he likes the
      quiet, but he will come again, like monsieur, because he has been here
      before. That is what I always say: &lsquo;Any one who has been here must
      come again.&rsquo; The problem is only to get them to come the first time.
      Truly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is the great man, Amedee?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! A distinguished professor of science. Truly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What science?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know. But he is a member of the Institute. Monsieur must
      have heard of that great Professor Keredec?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The name is known. Who is the other?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend of his. I do not know. All the upper floor of the east
      wing they have taken&mdash;the Grande Suite&mdash;those two and their
      valet-de-chambre. That is truly the way in modern times&mdash;the
      philosophers are rich men.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I sighed. &ldquo;Only the painters are poor nowadays.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha, monsieur!&rdquo; Amedee laughed cunningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was always easy to see that monsieur only amuses himself with
      his painting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Amedee,&rdquo; I responded. &ldquo;I have amused other
      people with it too, I fear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, without doubt!&rdquo; he agreed graciously, as he folded the
      cloth. I have always tried to believe that it was not so much my pictures
      as the fact that I paid my bills the day they were presented which
      convinced everybody about Les Trois Pigeons that I was an amateur. But I
      never became happily enough settled in this opinion to risk pressing an
      investigation; and it was a relief that Amedee changed the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur remembers the Chateau de Quesnay&mdash;at the crest of the
      hill on the road north of Dives?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is occupied this season by some rich Americans.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know they are rich?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dieu de Dieu!&rdquo; The old fellow appealed to heaven. &ldquo;But
      they are Americans!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And therefore millionaires. Perfectly, Amedee.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly, monsieur. Perhaps monsieur knows them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly!&rdquo; He affected dejection. &ldquo;And poor Madame
      Brossard thought monsieur had returned to our old hotel because he liked
      it, and remembered our wine of Beaune and the good beds and old Gaston&rsquo;s
      cooking!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not weep, Amedee,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I have come to paint;
      not because I know the people who have taken Quesnay.&rdquo; And I added:
      &ldquo;I may not see them at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth I thought that very probable. Miss Elizabeth had mentioned in one
      of her notes that Ward had leased Quesnay, but I had not sought quarters
      at Les Trois Pigeons because it stood within walking distance of the
      chateau. In my industrious frame of mind that circumstance seemed almost a
      drawback. Miss Elizabeth, ever hospitable to those whom she noticed at
      all, would be doubly so in the country, as people always are; and I wanted
      all my time to myself&mdash;no very selfish wish since my time was not
      conceivably of value to any one else. I thought it wise to leave any
      encounter with the lady to chance, and as the by-paths of the country-side
      were many and intricate, I intended, without ungallantry, to render the
      chance remote. George himself had just sailed on a business trip to
      America, as I knew from her last missive; and until his return, I should
      put in all my time at painting and nothing else, though I liked his
      sister, as I have said, and thought of her&mdash;often.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amedee doubted my sincerity, however, for he laughed incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, well, monsieur enjoys saying it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. It is a pleasure to say what one means.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But monsieur could not mean it. Monsieur will call at the chateau
      in the morning&rdquo;&mdash;the complacent varlet prophesied&mdash;&ldquo;as
      early as it will be polite. I am sure of that. Monsieur is not at all an
      old man; no, not yet! Even if he were, aha! no one could possess the
      friendship of that wonderful Madame d&rsquo;Armand and remain away from
      the chateau.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame d&rsquo;Armand?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;That is not the name.
      You mean Mademoiselle Ward.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; He shook his head and his fat cheeks bulged with a
      smile which I believe he intended to express a respectful roguishness.
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle Ward&rdquo; (he pronounced it &ldquo;Ware&rdquo;)
      &ldquo;is magnificent; every one must fly to obey when she opens her
      mouth. If she did not like the ocean there below the chateau, the ocean
      would have to move! It needs only a glance to perceive that Mademoiselle
      Ward is a great lady&mdash;but MADAME D&rsquo;ARMAND! AHA!&rdquo; He
      rolled his round eyes to an effect of unspeakable admiration, and with a
      gesture indicated that he would have kissed his hand to the stars, had
      that been properly reverential to Madame d&rsquo;Armand. &ldquo;But
      monsieur knows very well for himself!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur knows that you are very confusing&mdash;even for a maitre
      d&rsquo;hotel. We were speaking of the present chatelaine of Quesnay,
      Mademoiselle Ward. I have never heard of Madame d&rsquo;Armand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur is serious?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly!&rdquo; I answered, making bold to quote his shibboleth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then monsieur has truly much to live for. Truly!&rdquo; he chuckled
      openly, convinced that he had obtained a marked advantage in a conflict of
      wits, shaking his big head from side to side with an exasperating air of
      knowingness. &ldquo;Ah, truly! When that lady drives by, some day, in the
      carriage from the chateau&mdash;eh? Then monsieur will see how much he has
      to live for. Truly, truly, truly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had cleared the table, and now, with a final explosion of the word
      which gave him such immoderate satisfaction, he lifted the tray and made
      one of his precipitate departures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amedee,&rdquo; I said, as he slackened down to his sidelong
      leisure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is Madame d&rsquo;Armand?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A guest of Mademoiselle Ward at Quesnay. In fact, she is in charge
      of the chateau, since Mademoiselle Ward is, for the time, away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she a Frenchwoman?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems not. In fact, she is an American, though she dresses with
      so much of taste. Ah, Madame Brossard admits it, and Madame Brossard knows
      the art of dressing, for she spends a week of every winter in Rouen&mdash;and
      besides there is Trouville itself only some kilometres distant. Madame
      Brossard says that Mademoiselle Ward dresses with richness and splendour
      and Madame d&rsquo;Armand with economy, but beauty. Those were the words
      used by Madame Brossard. Truly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame d&rsquo;Armand&rsquo;s name is French,&rdquo; I observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is true,&rdquo; said Amedee thoughtfully. &ldquo;No one
      can deny it; it is a French name.&rdquo; He rested the tray upon a stump
      near by and scratched his head. &ldquo;I do not understand how that can
      be,&rdquo; he continued slowly. &ldquo;Jean Ferret, who is chief gardener
      at the chateau, is an acquaintance of mine. We sometimes have a cup of
      cider at Pere Baudry&rsquo;s, a kilometre down the road from here; and
      Jean Ferret has told me that she is an American. And yet, as you say,
      monsieur, the name is French. Perhaps she is French after all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that if I struggled a few days
      over this puzzle, I might come to the conclusion that Madame d&rsquo;Armand
      is an American lady who has married a Frenchman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man uttered an exclamation of triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! without doubt! Truly she must be an American lady who has
      married a Frenchman. Monsieur has already solved the puzzle. Truly, truly!&rdquo;
      And he trulied himself across the darkness, to emerge in the light of the
      open door of the kitchen with the word still rumbling in his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now for a time there came the clinking of dishes, sounds as of pans and
      kettles being scoured, the rolling gutturals of old Gaston, the cook, and
      the treble pipings of young &ldquo;Glouglou,&rdquo; his grandchild and
      scullion. After a while the oblong of light from the kitchen door
      disappeared; the voices departed; the stillness of the dark descended, and
      with it that unreasonable sense of pathos which night in the country
      brings to the heart of a wanderer. Then, out of the lonely silence, there
      issued a strange, incongruous sound as an execrable voice essayed to
      produce the semblance of an air odiously familiar about the streets of
      Paris some three years past, and I became aware of a smell of some
      dreadful thing burning. Beneath the arbour I perceived a glowing spark
      which seemed to bear a certain relation to an oval whitish patch
      suggesting the front of a shirt. It was Amedee, at ease, smoking his
      cigarette after the day&rsquo;s work and convinced that he was singing.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Pour qu&rsquo;j&rsquo;finisse
  Mon service
  Au Tonkin je suis parti&mdash;
  Ah! quel beau pays, mesdames!
  C&rsquo;est l&rsquo;paradis des p&rsquo;tites femmes!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      I rose from the chair on my little porch, to go to bed; but I was reminded
      of something, and called to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur?&rdquo; his voice came briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How often do you see your friend, Jean Ferret, the gardener of
      Quesnay?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frequently, monsieur. To-morrow morning I could easily carry a
      message if&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is precisely what I do not wish. And you may as well not
      mention me at all when you meet him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is understood. Perfectly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is well understood, there will be a beautiful present for a
      good maitre d&rsquo;hotel some day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, monsieur.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, Amedee.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, monsieur.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Falling to sleep has always been an intricate matter with me: I liken it
      to a nightly adventure in an enchanted palace. Weary-limbed and with
      burning eyelids, after long waiting in the outer court of wakefulness, I
      enter a dim, cool antechamber where the heavy garment of the body is left
      behind and where, perhaps, some acquaintance or friend greets me with a
      familiar speech or a bit of nonsense&mdash;or an unseen orchestra may play
      music that I know. From here I go into a spacious apartment where the air
      and light are of a fine clarity, for it is the hall of revelations, and in
      it the secrets of secrets are told, mysteries are resolved, perplexities
      cleared up, and sometimes I learn what to do about a picture that has
      bothered me. This is where I would linger, for beyond it I walk among
      crowding fantasies, delusions, terrors and shame, to a curtain of darkness
      where they take my memory from me, and I know nothing of my own adventures
      until I am pushed out of a secret door into the morning sunlight. Amedee
      was the acquaintance who met me in the antechamber to-night. He remarked
      that Madame d&rsquo;Armand was the most beautiful woman in the world, and
      vanished. And in the hall of revelations I thought that I found a statue
      of her&mdash;but it was veiled. I wished to remove the veil, but a passing
      stranger stopped and told me laughingly that the veil was all that would
      ever be revealed of her to me&mdash;of her, or any other woman!

      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was up with the birds in the morning; had my breakfast with them&mdash;a
      very drowsy-eyed Amedee assisting&mdash;and made off for the forest to get
      the sunrise through the branches, a pack on my back and three sandwiches
      for lunch in my pocket. I returned only with the failing light of evening,
      cheerfully tired and ready for a fine dinner and an early bed, both of
      which the good inn supplied. It was my daily programme; a healthy life
      &ldquo;far from the world,&rdquo; as Amedee said, and I was sorry when the
      serpent entered and disturbed it, though he was my own. He is a pet of
      mine; has been with me since my childhood. He leaves me when I live alone,
      for he loves company, but returns whenever my kind are about me. There are
      many names for snakes of his breed, but, to deal charitably with myself, I
      call mine Interest-In-Other-People&rsquo;s-Affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening I returned to find a big van from Dives, the nearest railway
      station, drawn up in the courtyard at the foot of the stairs leading to
      the gallery, and all of the people of the inn, from Madame Brossard (who
      directed) to Glouglou (who madly attempted the heaviest pieces), busily
      installing trunks, bags, and packing-cases in the suite engaged for the
      &ldquo;great man of science&rdquo; on the second floor of the east wing of
      the building. Neither the great man nor his companion was to be seen,
      however, both having retired to their rooms immediately upon their arrival&mdash;so
      Amedee informed me, as he wiped his brow after staggering up the steps
      under a load of books wrapped in sacking.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made my evening ablutions removing a Joseph&rsquo;s coat of dust and
      paint; and came forth from my pavilion, hoping that Professor Keredec and
      his friend would not mind eating in the same garden with a man in a
      corduroy jacket and knickerbockers; but the gentlemen continued invisible
      to the public eye, and mine was the only table set for dinner in the
      garden. Up-stairs the curtains were carefully drawn across all the windows
      of the east wing; little leaks of orange, here and there, betraying the
      lights within. Glouglou, bearing a tray of covered dishes, was just
      entering the salon of the &ldquo;Grande Suite,&rdquo; and the door closed
      quickly after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is to be supposed that Professor Keredec and his friend are
      fatigued with their journey from Paris?&rdquo; I began, a little later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, they did not seem fatigued,&rdquo; said Amedee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they dine in their own rooms to-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every night, monsieur. It is the order of Professor Keredec. And
      with their own valet-de-chambre to serve them. Eh?&rdquo; He poured my
      coffee solemnly. &ldquo;That is mysterious, to say the least, isn&rsquo;t
      it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To say the very least,&rdquo; I agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur the professor is a man of secrets, it appears,&rdquo;
      continued Amedee. &ldquo;When he wrote to Madame Brossard engaging his
      rooms, he instructed her to be careful that none of us should mention even
      his name; and to-day when he came, he spoke of his anxiety on that point.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you did mention it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To whom, monsieur?&rdquo; asked the old fellow blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I told him I had not,&rdquo; said Amedee placidly. &ldquo;It is
      the same thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; I began, struck by a sudden thought, &ldquo;if it
      will prove quite the same thing in my own case. I suppose you have not
      mentioned the circumstance of my being here to your friend, Jean Ferret of
      Quesnay?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me reproachfully. &ldquo;Has monsieur been troubled by the
      people of the chateau?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Troubled&rsquo; by them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have they come to seek out monsieur and disturb him? Have they done
      anything whatever to show that they have heard monsieur is here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, certainly they haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I was obliged to retract
      at once. &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Amedee.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, monsieur!&rdquo; He made a deprecatory bow (which plunged me
      still deeper in shame), struck a match, and offered a light for my cigar
      with a forgiving hand. &ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; he pursued, &ldquo;it
      seems very mysterious&mdash;this Keredec affair!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To comprehend a great man, Amedee,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is the
      next thing to sharing his greatness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He blinked slightly, pondered a moment upon this sententious drivel, then
      very properly ignored it, reverting to his puzzle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is it not incomprehensible that people should eat indoors this
      fine weather?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I admitted that it was. I knew very well how hot and stuffy the salon of
      Madame Brossard&rsquo;s &ldquo;Grande Suite&rdquo; must be, while the
      garden was fragrant in the warm, dry night, and the outdoor air like a
      gentle tonic. Nevertheless, Professor Keredec and his friend preferred the
      salon.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a man is leading a very quiet and isolated life, it is inconceivable
      what trifles will occupy and concentrate his attention. The smaller the
      community the more blowzy with gossip you are sure to find it; and I have
      little doubt that when Friday learned enough English, one of the first
      things Crusoe did was to tell him some scandal about the goat. Thus,
      though I treated the &ldquo;Keredec affair&rdquo; with a seeming airiness
      to Amedee, I cunningly drew the faithful rascal out, and fed my curiosity
      upon his own (which, as time went on and the mystery deepened, seemed
      likely to burst him), until, virtually, I was receiving, every evening at
      dinner, a detailed report of the day&rsquo;s doings of Professor Keredec
      and his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reports were voluminous, the details few. The two gentlemen, as Amedee
      would relate, spent their forenoons over books and writing in their rooms.
      Professor Keredec&rsquo;s voice could often be heard in every part of the
      inn; at times holding forth with such protracted vehemence that only one
      explanation would suffice: the learned man was delivering a lecture to his
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say then!&rdquo; exclaimed Amedee&mdash;&ldquo;what king of madness
      is that? To make orations for only one auditor!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He brushed away my suggestion that the auditor might be a stenographer to
      whom the professor was dictating chapters for a new book. The relation
      between the two men, he contended, was more like that between teacher and
      pupil. &ldquo;But a pupil with gray hair!&rdquo; he finished, raising his
      fat hands to heaven. &ldquo;For that other monsieur has hair as gray as
      mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That other monsieur&rdquo; was farther described as a thin man,
      handsome, but with a &ldquo;singular air,&rdquo; nor could my colleague
      more satisfactorily define this air, though he made a racking struggle to
      do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what does the peculiarity of his manner lie?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is not so much that his manner is peculiar, monsieur; it is
      an air about him that is singular. Truly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how is it singular?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, it is very, very singular.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not understand,&rdquo; I insisted. &ldquo;What kind of
      singularity has the air of &lsquo;that other monsieur&rsquo;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has,&rdquo; replied Amedee, with a powerful effort, &ldquo;a
      very singular singularity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was as near as he could come, and, fearful of injuring him, I
      abandoned that phase of our subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      The valet-de-chambre whom my fellow-lodgers had brought with them from
      Paris contributed nothing to the inn&rsquo;s knowledge of his masters, I
      learned. This struck me not only as odd, but unique, for French servants
      tell one another everything, and more&mdash;very much more. &ldquo;But
      this is a silent man,&rdquo; said Amedee impressively. &ldquo;Oh! very
      silent! He shakes his head wisely, yet he will not open his mouth.
      However, that may be because&rdquo;&mdash;and now the explanation came&mdash;&ldquo;because
      he was engaged only last week and knows nothing. Also, he is but
      temporary; he returns to Paris soon and Glouglou is to serve them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I ascertained that although &ldquo;that other monsieur&rdquo; had gray
      hair, he was by no means a person of great age; indeed, Glouglou, who had
      seen him oftener than any other of the staff, maintained that he was quite
      young. Amedee&rsquo;s own opportunities for observation had been limited.
      Every afternoon the two gentlemen went for a walk; but they always came
      down from the gallery so quickly, he declared, and, leaving the inn by a
      rear entrance, plunged so hastily into the nearest by-path leading to the
      forest, that he caught little more than glimpses of them. They returned
      after an hour or so, entering the inn with the same appearance of haste to
      be out of sight, the professor always talking, &ldquo;with the manner of
      an orator, but in English.&rdquo; Nevertheless, Amedee remarked, it was
      certain that Professor Keredec&rsquo;s friend was neither an American nor
      an Englishman. &ldquo;Why is it certain?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, he drinks nothing but water, he does not smoke, and
      Glouglou says he speaks very pure French.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glouglou is an authority who resolves the difficulty. &lsquo;That
      other monsieur&rsquo; is a Frenchman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, monsieur, he is smooth-shaven.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he has been a maitre d&rsquo;hotel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! I wish one that <i>I</i> know could hope to dress as well when
      he retires! Besides, Glouglou says that other monsieur eats his soup
      silently.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can find no flaw in the deduction,&rdquo; I said, rising to go to
      bed. &ldquo;We must leave it there for to-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The next evening Amedee allowed me to perceive that he was concealing
      something under his arm as he stoked the coffee-machine, and upon my
      asking what it was, he glanced round the courtyard with histrionic
      slyness, placed the object on the table beside my cap, and stepped back to
      watch the impression, his manner that of one who declaims: &ldquo;At last
      the missing papers are before you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a book.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am persuaded by your candour, Amedee, as well as by the general
      appearance of this article,&rdquo; I returned as I picked it up, &ldquo;that
      you are speaking the truth. But why do you bring it to me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; he replied, in the tones of an old conspirator,
      &ldquo;this afternoon the professor and that other monsieur went as usual
      to walk in the forest.&rdquo; He bent over me, pretending to be busy with
      the coffee-machine, and lowering his voice to a hoarse whisper. &ldquo;When
      they returned, this book fell from the pocket of that other monsieur&rsquo;s
      coat as he ascended the stair, and he did not notice. Later I shall return
      it by Glouglou, but I thought it wise that monsieur should see it for
      himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The book was Wentworth&rsquo;s Algebra&mdash;elementary principles.
      Painful recollections of my boyhood and the binomial theorem rose in my
      mind as I let the leaves turn under my fingers. &ldquo;What do you make of
      it?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      His tone became even more confidential. &ldquo;Part of it, monsieur, is in
      English; that is plain. I have found an English word in it that I know&mdash;the
      word &lsquo;O.&rsquo; But much of the printing is also in Arabic.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arabic!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur, look there.&rdquo; He laid a fat forefinger on
      &ldquo;(a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2.&rdquo; &ldquo;That is Arabic. Old Gaston
      has been to Algeria, and he says that he knows Arabic as well as he does
      French. He looked at the book and told me it was Arabic. Truly! Truly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he translate any of it for you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur; his eyes pained him this afternoon. He says he will
      read it to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must return the book to-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true. Eh! It leaves the mystery deeper than ever, unless
      monsieur can find some clue in those parts of the book that are English.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I shed no light upon him. The book had been Greek to me in my tender
      years; it was a pleasure now to leave a fellow-being under the impression
      that it was Arabic.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the volume took its little revenge upon me, for it increased my
      curiosity about Professor Keredec and &ldquo;that other monsieur.&rdquo;
      Why were two grown men&mdash;one an eminent psychologist and the other a
      gray-haired youth with a singular air&mdash;carrying about on their walks
      a text-book for the instruction of boys of thirteen or fourteen?
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day that curiosity of mine was piqued in earnest. It rained and I
      did not leave the inn, but sat under the great archway and took notes in
      colour of the shining road, bright drenched fields, and dripping sky. My
      back was toward the courtyard, that is, &ldquo;three-quarters&rdquo; to
      it, and about noon I became distracted from my work by a strong
      self-consciousness which came upon me without any visible or audible
      cause. Obeying an impulse, I swung round on my camp-stool and looked up
      directly at the gallery window of the salon of the &ldquo;Grande Suite.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A man with a great white beard was standing at the window, half hidden by
      the curtain, watching me intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      He perceived that I saw him and dropped the curtain immediately, a speck
      of colour in his buttonhole catching my eye as it fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spy was Professor Keredec.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why should he study me so slyly and yet so obviously? I had no
      intention of intruding upon him. Nor was I a psychological &ldquo;specimen,&rdquo;
      though I began to suspect that &ldquo;that other monsieur&rdquo; WAS.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      I had been painting in various parts of the forest, studying the early
      morning along the eastern fringe and moving deeper in as the day advanced.
      For the stillness and warmth of noon I went to the very woodland heart,
      and in the late afternoon moved westward to a glade&mdash;a chance arena
      open to the sky, the scene of my most audacious endeavours, for here I was
      trying to paint foliage luminous under those long shafts of sunshine which
      grow thinner but ruddier toward sunset. A path closely bordered by
      underbrush wound its way to the glade, crossed it, then wandered away into
      shady dingles again; and with my easel pitched in the mouth of this path,
      I sat at work, one late afternoon, wonderful for its still loveliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The path debouched abruptly on the glade and was so narrow that when I
      leaned back my elbows were in the bushes, and it needed care to keep my
      palette from being smirched by the leaves; though there was more room for
      my canvas and easel, as I had placed them at arm&rsquo;s length before me,
      fairly in the open. I had the ambition to paint a picture here&mdash;to do
      the whole thing in the woods from day to day, instead of taking notes for
      the studio&mdash;and was at work upon a very foolish experiment: I had
      thought to render the light&mdash;broken by the branches and foliage&mdash;with
      broken brush-work, a short stroke of the kind that stung an elder painter
      to swear that its practitioners painted in shaking fear of the concierge
      appearing for the studio rent. The attempt was alluring, but when I rose
      from my camp-stool and stepped back into the path to get more distance for
      my canvas, I saw what a mess I was making of it. At the same time, my
      hand, falling into the capacious pocket of my jacket, encountered a
      package, my lunch, which I had forgotten to eat, whereupon, becoming
      suddenly aware that I was very hungry, I began to eat Amedee&rsquo;s good
      sandwiches without moving from where I stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absorbed, gazing with abysmal disgust at my canvas, I was eating
      absent-mindedly&mdash;and with all the restraint and dignity of a Georgia
      darky attacking a watermelon&mdash;when a pleasant voice spoke from just
      behind me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon, monsieur; permit me to pass, if you please.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That was all it said, very quietly and in French, but a gunshot might have
      startled me less.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned in confusion to behold a dark-eyed lady, charmingly dressed in
      lilac and white, waiting for me to make way so that she could pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nay, let me leave no detail of my mortification unrecorded: I have just
      said that I &ldquo;turned in confusion&rdquo;; the truth is that I jumped
      like a kangaroo, but with infinitely less grace. And in my nervous haste
      to clear her way, meaning only to push the camp-stool out of the path with
      my foot, I put too much valour into the push, and with horror saw the
      camp-stool rise in the air and drop to the ground again nearly a third of
      the distance across the glade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon that I squeezed myself back into the bushes, my ears singing and my
      cheeks burning.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are women who will meet or pass a strange man in the woods or fields
      with as finished an air of being unaware of him (particularly if he be a
      rather shabby painter no longer young) as if the encounter took place on a
      city sidewalk; but this woman was not of that priggish kind. Her
      straightforward glance recognised my existence as a fellow-being; and she
      further acknowledged it by a faint smile, which was of courtesy only,
      however, and admitted no reference to the fact that at the first sound of
      her voice I had leaped into the air, kicked a camp-stool twenty feet, and
      now stood blushing, so shamefully stuffed with sandwich that I dared not
      speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said as she went by; and made me a little bow
      so graceful that it almost consoled me for my caperings.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood looking after her as she crossed the clearing and entered the cool
      winding of the path on the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stared and wished&mdash;wished that I could have painted her into my
      picture, with the thin, ruddy sunshine flecking her dress; wished that I
      had not cut such an idiotic figure. I stared until her filmy summer hat,
      which was the last bit of her to disappear, had vanished. Then,
      discovering that I still held the horrid remains of a sausage-sandwich in
      my hand, I threw it into the underbrush with unnecessary force, and,
      recovering my camp-stool, sat down to work again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not immediately begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passing of a pretty woman anywhere never comes to be quite of no
      moment to a man, and the passing of a pretty woman in the greenwood is an
      episode&mdash;even to a middle-aged landscape painter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An episode?&rdquo; quoth I. I should be ashamed to withhold the
      truth out of my fear to be taken for a sentimentalist: this woman who had
      passed was of great and instant charm; it was as if I had heard a serenade
      there in the woods&mdash;and at thought of the jig I had danced to it my
      face burned again.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a sigh of no meaning, I got my eyes down to my canvas and began to
      peck at it perfunctorily, when a snapping of twigs underfoot and a
      swishing of branches in the thicket warned me of a second intruder, not
      approaching by the path, but forcing a way toward it through the
      underbrush, and very briskly too, judging by the sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      He burst out into the glade a few paces from me, a tall man in white
      flannels, liberally decorated with brambles and clinging shreds of
      underbrush. A streamer of vine had caught about his shoulders; there were
      leaves on his bare head, and this, together with the youthful
      sprightliness of his light figure and the naive activity of his approach,
      gave me a very faunlike first impression of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of me he stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen a lady in a white and lilac dress and with roses in
      her hat?&rdquo; he demanded, omitting all preface and speaking with a
      quick eagerness which caused me no wonder&mdash;for I had seen the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      What did surprise me, however, was the instantaneous certainty with which
      I recognised the speaker from Amedee&rsquo;s description; certainty
      founded on the very item which had so dangerously strained the old fellow&rsquo;s
      powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      My sudden gentleman was strikingly good-looking, his complexion so clear
      and boyishly healthy, that, except for his gray hair, he might have passed
      for twenty-two or twenty-three, and even as it was I guessed his years
      short of thirty; but there are plenty of handsome young fellows with
      prematurely gray hair, and, as Amedee said, though out of the world we
      were near it. It was the new-comer&rsquo;s &ldquo;singular air&rdquo;
      which established his identity. Amedee&rsquo;s vagueness had irked me, but
      the thing itself&mdash;the &ldquo;singular air&rdquo;&mdash;was not at all
      vague. Instantly perceptible, it was an investiture; marked, definite&mdash;and
      intangible. My interrogator was &ldquo;that other monsieur.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In response to his question I asked him another:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were the roses real or artificial?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he answered, with what I took to be a
      whimsical assumption of gravity. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t matter, would
      it? Have you seen her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stooped to brush the brambles from his trousers, sending me a sidelong
      glance from his blue eyes, which were brightly confident and inquiring,
      like a boy&rsquo;s. At the same time it struck me that whatever the nature
      of the singularity investing him it partook of nothing repellent, but, on
      the contrary, measurably enhanced his attractiveness; making him &ldquo;different&rdquo;
      and lending him a distinction which, without it, he might have lacked. And
      yet, patent as this singularity must have been to the dullest, it was
      something quite apart from any eccentricity of manner, though, heaven
      knows, I was soon to think him odd enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t your description,&rdquo; I said gravely, thinking to
      suit my humour to his own, &ldquo;somewhat too general? Over yonder a few
      miles lies Houlgate. Trouville itself is not so far, and this is the
      season. A great many white hats trimmed with roses might come for a stroll
      in these woods. If you would complete the items&mdash;&rdquo; and I waved
      my hand as if inviting him to continue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen her only once before,&rdquo; he responded promptly,
      with a seriousness apparently quite genuine. &ldquo;That was from my
      window at an inn, three days ago. She drove by in an open carriage without
      looking up, but I could see that she was very handsome. No&mdash;&rdquo;
      he broke off abruptly, but as quickly resumed&mdash;&ldquo;handsome isn&rsquo;t
      just what I mean. Lovely, I should say. That is more like her and a better
      thing to be, shouldn&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably&mdash;yes&mdash;I think so,&rdquo; I stammered, in
      considerable amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She went by quickly,&rdquo; he said, as if he were talking in the
      most natural and ordinary way in the world, &ldquo;but I noticed that
      while she was in the shade of the inn her hair appeared to be dark, though
      when the carriage got into the sunlight again it looked fair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I had noticed the same thing when the lady who had passed emerged from the
      shadows of the path into the sunshine of the glade, but I did not speak of
      it now; partly because he gave me no opportunity, partly because I was
      almost too astonished to speak at all, for I was no longer under the
      delusion that he had any humourous or whimsical intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little while ago,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I was up in the
      branches of a tree over yonder, and I caught a glimpse of a lady in a
      light dress and a white hat and I thought it might be the same. She wore a
      dress like that and a white hat with roses when she drove by the inn. I am
      very anxious to see her again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to be!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And haven&rsquo;t you seen her? Hasn&rsquo;t she passed this way?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He urged the question with the same strange eagerness which had marked his
      manner from the first, a manner which confounded me by its absurd
      resemblance to that of a boy who had not mixed with other boys and had
      never been teased. And yet his expression was intelligent and alert; nor
      was there anything abnormal or &ldquo;queer&rdquo; in his good-humoured
      gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that I may have seen her,&rdquo; I began slowly; &ldquo;but
      if you do not know her I should not advise&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I was interrupted by a shout and the sound of a large body plunging in the
      thicket. At this the face of &ldquo;that other monsieur&rdquo; flushed
      slightly; he smiled, but seemed troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a friend of mine,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am afraid he
      will want me to go back with him.&rdquo; And he raised an answering shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor Keredec floundered out through the last row of saplings and
      bushes, his beard embellished with a broken twig, his big face red and
      perspiring. He was a fine, a mighty man, ponderous of shoulder, monumental
      of height, stupendous of girth; there was cloth enough in the hot-looking
      black frock-coat he wore for the canopy of a small pavilion. Half a dozen
      books were under his arm, and in his hand he carried a hat which evidently
      belonged to &ldquo;that other monsieur,&rdquo; for his own was on his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      One glance of scrutiny and recognition he shot at me from his
      silver-rimmed spectacles; and seized the young man by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, my friend!&rdquo; he exclaimed in a bass voice of astounding
      power and depth, &ldquo;that is one way to study botany: to jump out of
      the middle of a high tree and to run like a crazy man!&rdquo; He spoke
      with a strong accent and a thunderous rolling of the &ldquo;r.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;What was I to think?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;What has arrived to
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw a lady I wished to follow,&rdquo; the other answered
      promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lady! What lady?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lady who passed the inn three days ago. I spoke of her then,
      you remember.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tonnerre de Dieu!&rdquo; Keredec slapped his thigh with the sudden
      violence of a man who remembers that he has forgotten something, and as a
      final addition to my amazement, his voice rang more of remorse than of
      reproach. &ldquo;Have I never told you that to follow strange ladies is
      one of the things you cannot do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That other monsieur&rdquo; shook his head. &ldquo;No, you have
      never told me that. I do not understand it,&rdquo; he said, adding
      irrelevantly, &ldquo;I believe this gentleman knows her. He says he thinks
      he has seen her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, we must not trouble this gentleman about it,&rdquo;
      said the professor hastily. &ldquo;Put on your hat, in the name of a
      thousand saints, and let us go!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I wish to ask him her name,&rdquo; urged the other, with
      something curiously like the obstinacy of a child. &ldquo;I wish&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; Keredec took him by the arm. &ldquo;We must go. We
      shall be late for our dinner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why?&rdquo; persisted the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now!&rdquo; The professor removed his broad felt hat and
      hurriedly wiped his vast and steaming brow&mdash;a magnificent structure,
      corniced, at this moment, with anxiety. &ldquo;It is better if we do not
      discuss it now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I might not meet him again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor Keredec turned toward me with a half-desperate, half-apologetic
      laugh which was like the rumbling of heavy wagons over a block pavement;
      and in his flustered face I thought I read a signal of genuine distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know the lady,&rdquo; I said with some sharpness. &ldquo;I
      have never seen her until this afternoon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this &ldquo;that other monsieur&rdquo; astonished me in good earnest.
      Searching my eyes eagerly with his clear, inquisitive gaze, he took a step
      toward me and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are sure you are telling the truth?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The professor uttered an exclamation of horror, sprang forward, and
      clutched his friend&rsquo;s arm again. &ldquo;Malheureux!&rdquo; he cried,
      and then to me: &ldquo;Sir, you will give him pardon if you can? He has no
      meaning to be rude.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rude?&rdquo; The young man&rsquo;s voice showed both astonishment
      and pain. &ldquo;Was that rude? I didn&rsquo;t know. I didn&rsquo;t mean
      to be rude, God knows! Ah,&rdquo; he said sadly, &ldquo;I do nothing but
      make mistakes. I hope you will forgive me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his hand as if in appeal, and let it drop to his side; and in
      the action, as well as in the tone of his voice and his attitude of
      contrition, there was something that reached me suddenly, with the touch
      of pathos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I am only sorry that it was the
      truth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said, and turned humbly to Keredec.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, that is better!&rdquo; shouted the great man, apparently
      relieved of a vast weight. &ldquo;We shall go home now and eat a good
      dinner. But first&mdash;&rdquo; his silver-rimmed spectacles twinkled upon
      me, and he bent his Brobdingnagian back in a bow which against my will
      reminded me of the curtseys performed by Orloff&rsquo;s dancing bears&mdash;&ldquo;first
      let me speak some words for myself. My dear sir&rdquo;&mdash;he addressed
      himself to me with grave formality&mdash;&ldquo;do not suppose I have no
      realization that other excuses should be made to you. Believe me, they
      shall be. It is now that I see it is fortunate for us that you are our
      fellow-innsman at Les Trois Pigeons.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I was unable to resist the opportunity, and, affecting considerable
      surprise, interrupted him with the apparently guileless query:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how did you know that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor Keredec&rsquo;s laughter rumbled again, growing deeper and
      louder till it reverberated in the woods and a hundred hale old trees
      laughed back at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho, ho, ho!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;But you shall not take me for
      a window-curtain spy! That is a fine reputation I give myself with you!
      Ho, ho!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, followed submissively by &ldquo;that other monsieur,&rdquo; he
      strode into the path and went thundering forth through the forest.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      No doubt the most absurd thing I could have done after the departure of
      Professor Keredec and his singular friend would have been to settle myself
      before my canvas again with the intention of painting&mdash;and that is
      what I did. At least, I resumed my camp-stool and went through some of the
      motions habitually connected with the act of painting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember that the first time in my juvenile reading I came upon the
      phrase, &ldquo;seated in a brown study,&rdquo; I pictured my hero in a
      brown chair, beside a brown table, in a room hung with brown paper. Later,
      being enlightened, I was ambitious to display the figure myself, but the
      uses of ordinary correspondence allowed the occasion for it to remain
      unoffered. Let me not only seize upon the present opportunity but gild it,
      for the adventure of the afternoon left me in a study which was, at its
      mildest, a profound purple.
    </p>
    <p>
      The confession has been made of my curiosity concerning my fellow-lodgers
      at Les Trois Pigeons; however, it had been comparatively a torpid growth;
      my meeting with them served to enlarge it so suddenly and to such
      proportions that I wonder it did not strangle me. In fine, I sat there
      brush-paddling my failure like an automaton, and saying over and over
      aloud, &ldquo;What is wrong with him? What is wrong with him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the sillier inasmuch as the word &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; (bearing any
      significance of a darkened mind) had not the slightest application to
      &ldquo;that other monsieur.&rdquo; There had been neither darkness nor
      dullness; his eyes, his expression, his manner, betrayed no hint of
      wildness; rather they bespoke a quick and amiable intelligence&mdash;the
      more amazing that he had shown himself ignorant of things a child of ten
      would know. Amedee and his fellows of Les Trois Pigeons had judged wrongly
      of his nationality; his face was of the lean, right, American structure;
      but they had hit the relation between the two men: Keredec was the master
      and &ldquo;that other monsieur&rdquo; the scholar&mdash;a pupil studying
      boys&rsquo; textbooks and receiving instruction in matters and manners
      that children are taught. And yet I could not believe him to be a simple
      case of arrested development. For the matter of that, I did not like to
      think of him as a &ldquo;case&rdquo; at all. There had been something
      about his bright youthfulness&mdash;perhaps it was his quick contrition
      for his rudeness, perhaps it was a certain wistful quality he had, perhaps
      it was his very &ldquo;singularity&rdquo;&mdash;which appealed as directly
      to my liking as it did urgently to my sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I came out of my vari-coloured study with a start, caused by the discovery
      that I had absent-mindedly squeezed upon my palette the entire contents of
      an expensive tube of cobalt violet, for which I had no present use; and
      sighing (for, of necessity, I am an economical man), I postponed both of
      my problems till another day, determined to efface the one with a palette
      knife and a rag soaked in turpentine, and to defer the other until I
      should know more of my fellow-lodgers at Madame Brossard&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      The turpentine rag at least proved effective; I scoured away the last
      tokens of my failure with it, wishing that life were like the canvas and
      that men had knowledge of the right celestial turpentine. After that I
      cleaned my brushes, packed and shouldered my kit, and, with a final
      imprecation upon all sausage-sandwiches, took up my way once more to Les
      Trois Pigeons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently I came upon an intersecting path where, on my previous
      excursions, I had always borne to the right; but this evening, thinking to
      discover a shorter cut, I went straight ahead. Striding along at a good
      gait and chanting sonorously, &ldquo;On Linden when the sun was low,&rdquo;
      I left the rougher boscages of the forest behind me and emerged, just at
      sunset, upon an orderly fringe of woodland where the ground was neat and
      unencumbered, and the trimmed trees stood at polite distances, bowing
      slightly to one another with small, well-bred rustlings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light was somewhere between gold and pink when I came into this lady&rsquo;s
      boudoir of a grove. &ldquo;Isar flowing rapidly&rdquo; ceased its tumult
      abruptly, and Linden saw no sterner sight that evening: my voice and my
      feet stopped simultaneously&mdash;for I stood upon Quesnay ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before me stretched a short broad avenue of turf, leading to the chateau
      gates. These stood open, a gravelled driveway climbing thence by easy
      stages between kempt shrubberies to the crest of the hill, where the gray
      roof and red chimney-pots of the chateau were glimpsed among the
      tree-tops. The slope was terraced with strips of flower-gardens and
      intervals of sward; and against the green of a rising lawn I marked the
      figure of a woman, pausing to bend over some flowering bush. The figure
      was too slender to be mistaken for that of the present chatelaine of
      Quesnay: in Miss Elizabeth&rsquo;s regal amplitude there was never any
      hint of fragility. The lady upon the slope, then, I concluded, must be
      Madame d&rsquo;Armand, the inspiration of Amedee&rsquo;s &ldquo;Monsieur
      has much to live for!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more this day I indorsed that worthy man&rsquo;s opinion, for, though
      I was too far distant to see clearly, I knew that roses trimmed Madame d&rsquo;Armand&rsquo;s
      white hat, and that she had passed me, no long time since, in the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took off my cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the honour to salute you,&rdquo; I said aloud. &ldquo;I make
      my apologies for misbehaving with sandwiches and camp-stools in your
      presence, Madame d&rsquo;Armand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in my own pronunciation of her name struck me as reminiscent:
      save for the prefix, it had sounded like &ldquo;Harman,&rdquo; as a
      Frenchman might pronounce it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foreign names involve the French in terrible difficulties. Hughes, an
      English friend of mine, has lived in France some five-and-thirty years
      without reconciling himself to being known as &ldquo;Monsieur Ig.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Armand&rdquo; might easily be Jean Ferret&rsquo;s translation of
      &ldquo;Harman.&rdquo; Had he and Amedee in their admiration conferred the
      prefix because they considered it a plausible accompaniment to the lady&rsquo;s
      gentle bearing? It was not impossible; it was, I concluded, very probable.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had come far out of my way, so I retraced my steps to the intersection
      of the paths, and thence made for the inn by my accustomed route. The
      light failed under the roofing of foliage long before I was free of the
      woods, and I emerged upon the road to Les Trois Pigeons when twilight had
      turned to dusk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not far along the road from where I came into it, stood an old, brown,
      deep-thatched cottage&mdash;a branch of brushwood over the door prettily
      beckoning travellers to the knowledge that cider was here for the thirsty;
      and as I drew near I perceived that one availed himself of the invitation.
      A group stood about the open door, the lamp-light from within disclosing
      the head of the house filling a cup for the wayfarer; while honest Mere
      Baudry and two generations of younger Baudrys clustered to miss no word of
      the interchange of courtesies between Pere Baudry and his chance patron.
    </p>
    <p>
      It afforded me some surprise to observe that the latter was a most mundane
      and elaborate wayfarer, indeed; a small young man very lightly made, like
      a jockey, and point-device in khaki, puttees, pongee cap, white-and-green
      stock, a knapsack on his back, and a bamboo stick under his arm;
      altogether equipped to such a high point of pedestrianism that a cynical
      person might have been reminded of loud calls for wine at some hostelry in
      the land of opera bouffe. He was speaking fluently, though with a
      detestable accent, in a rough-and-ready, pick-up dialect of Parisian
      slang, evidently under the pleasant delusion that he employed the French
      language, while Pere Baudry contributed his share of the conversation in a
      slow patois. As both men spoke at the same time and neither understood two
      consecutive words the other said, it struck me that the dialogue might
      prove unproductive of any highly important results this side of
      Michaelmas; therefore, discovering that the very pedestrian gentleman was
      making some sort of inquiry concerning Les Trois Pigeons, I came to a halt
      and proffered aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you looking for Madame Brossard&rsquo;s?&rdquo; I asked in
      English.
    </p>
    <p>
      The traveller uttered an exclamation and faced about with a jump, birdlike
      for quickness. He did not reply to my question with the same promptness;
      however, his deliberation denoted scrutiny, not sloth. He stood peering at
      me sharply until I repeated it. Even then he protracted his examination of
      me, a favour I was unable to return with any interest, owing to the
      circumstance of his back being toward the light. Nevertheless, I got a
      clear enough impression of his alert, well-poised little figure, and of a
      hatchety little face, and a pair of shrewd little eyes, which (I thought)
      held a fine little conceit of his whole little person. It was a type of
      fellow-countryman not altogether unknown about certain &ldquo;American
      Bars&rdquo; of Paris, and usually connected (more or less directly) with
      what is known to the people of France as &ldquo;le Sport.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he responded in a voice of unpleasant nasality, finally
      deciding upon speech, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re &lsquo;Nummeric&rsquo;n, ain&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;I thought I heard you inquiring for&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, m&rsquo; friend, you can sting me!&rdquo; he interrupted with
      condescending jocularity. &ldquo;My style French does f&rsquo;r them
      camels up in Paris all right. ME at Nice, Monte Carlo, Chantilly&mdash;bow
      to the p&rsquo;fess&rsquo;r; he&rsquo;s RIGHT! But down here I don&rsquo;t
      seem to be GUD enough f&rsquo;r these sheep-dogs; anyway they bark
      different. I&rsquo;m lukkin&rsquo; fer a hotel called Les Trois Pigeons.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going there,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I will show you the way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whur is&rsquo;t?&rdquo; he asked, not moving.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pointed to the lights of the inn, flickering across the fields. &ldquo;Yonder&mdash;beyond
      the second turn of the road,&rdquo; I said, and, as he showed no signs of
      accompanying me, I added, &ldquo;I am rather late.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; there t&rsquo;night. It&rsquo;s too
      dark t&rsquo; see anything now,&rdquo; he remarked, to my astonishment.
      &ldquo;Dives and the choo-choo back t&rsquo; little ole Trouville f&rsquo;r
      mine! I on&rsquo;y wanted to take a LUK at this pigeon-house joint.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind my inquiring,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;what you expected
      to see at Les Trois Pigeons?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as if astonished at the question, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      a tourist. Makin&rsquo; a pedestrun trip t&rsquo; all the reg&rsquo;ler
      sights.&rdquo; And, inspired to eloquence, he added, as an afterthought:
      &ldquo;As it were.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A tourist?&rdquo; I echoed, with perfect incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s whut I am, m&rsquo; friend,&rdquo; he returned firmly.
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to have a red dope-book in one hand and a
      thoid-class choo-choo ticket in the other to be a tourist, do you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you will pardon me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;where did you get
      the notion that Les Trois Pigeons is one of the regular sights?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it in all the books?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that it is mentioned in any of the guide-books.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;NO! I didn&rsquo;t say it WAS, m&rsquo; friend,&rdquo; he retorted
      with contemptuous pity. &ldquo;I mean them history-books. It&rsquo;s in
      all o&rsquo; THEM!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is strange news,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I should be very much
      interested to read them!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lookahere,&rdquo; he said, taking a step nearer me; &ldquo;in
      oinest now, on your woid: Didn&rsquo; more&rsquo;n half them Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc
      tamales live at that hotel wunst?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody of historical importance&mdash;or any other kind of
      importance, so far as I know&mdash;ever lived there,&rdquo; I informed
      him. &ldquo;The older portions of the inn once belonged to an ancient
      farm-house, that is all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the level,&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t that William
      the Conker nor NONE o&rsquo; them ancient gilt-edges live there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stung again!&rdquo; He broke into a sudden loud cackle of laughter.
      &ldquo;Why! the feller tole me &lsquo;at this here Pigeon place was all
      three rings when it come t&rsquo; history. Yessir! Tall, thin feller he
      was, in a three-button cutaway, English make, and kind of red-complected,
      with a sandy MUS-tache,&rdquo; pursued the pedestrian, apparently fearing
      his narrative might lack colour. &ldquo;I met him right comin&rsquo; out o&rsquo;
      the Casino at Trouville, yes&rsquo;day aft&rsquo;noon; c&rsquo;udn&rsquo;
      a&rsquo; b&rsquo;en more&rsquo;n four o&rsquo;clock&mdash;hol&rsquo; on
      though, yes &lsquo;twas, &lsquo;twas nearer five, about twunty minutes t&rsquo;
      five, say&mdash;an&rsquo; this feller tells me&mdash;&rdquo; He cackled
      with laughter as palpably disingenuous as the corroborative details he
      thought necessary to muster, then he became serious, as if marvelling at
      his own wondrous verdancy. &ldquo;M&rsquo; friend, that feller soitn&rsquo;y
      found me easy. But he can&rsquo;t say I ain&rsquo;t game; he passes me the
      limes, but I&rsquo;m jest man enough to drink his health fer it in this
      sweet, sound ole-fashioned cider &lsquo;at ain&rsquo;t got a headache in a
      barrel of it. He played me GUD, and here&rsquo;s TO him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite the heartiness of the sentiment, my honest tourist&rsquo;s
      enthusiasm seemed largely histrionic, and his quaffing of the beaker too
      reminiscent of drain-the-wine-cup-free in the second row of the chorus,
      for he absently allowed it to dangle from his hand before raising it to
      his lips. However, not all of its contents was spilled, and he swallowed a
      mouthful of the sweet, sound, old-fashioned cider&mdash;but by mistake, I
      was led to suppose, from the expression of displeasure which became so
      deeply marked upon his countenance as to be noticeable, even in the feeble
      lamplight.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tarried no longer, but bidding this good youth and the generations of
      Baudry good-night, hastened on to my belated dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amedee,&rdquo; I said, when my cigar was lighted and the usual hour
      of consultation had arrived; &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t that old lock on the chest
      where Madame Brossard keeps her silver getting rather rusty?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, we have no thieves here. We are out of the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but Trouville is not so far away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many strange people go to Trouville: grand-dukes, millionaires,
      opera singers, princes, jockeys, gamblers&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly, truly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And tourists,&rdquo; I finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well known,&rdquo; assented Amedee, nodding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It follows,&rdquo; I continued with the impressiveness of all
      logicians, &ldquo;that many strange people may come from Trouville. In
      their excursions to the surrounding points of interest&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, monsieur, but that is true!&rdquo; he interrupted, laying his
      right forefinger across the bridge of his nose, which was his gesture when
      he remembered anything suddenly. &ldquo;There was a strange monsieur from
      Trouville here this very day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of person was he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A foreigner, but I could not tell from what country.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time of day was he here?&rdquo; I asked, with growing
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toward the middle of the afternoon. I was alone, except for
      Glouglou, when he came. He wished to see the whole house and I showed him
      what I could, except of course monsieur&rsquo;s pavilion, and the Grande
      Suite. Monsieur the Professor and that other monsieur had gone to the
      forest, but I did not feel at liberty to exhibit their rooms without
      Madame Brossard&rsquo;s permission, and she was spending the day at Dives.
      Besides,&rdquo; added the good man, languidly snapping a napkin at a moth
      near one of the candles, &ldquo;the doors were locked.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This person was a tourist?&rdquo; I asked, after a pause during
      which Amedee seemed peacefully unaware of the rather concentrated gaze I
      had fixed upon him. &ldquo;Of a kind. In speaking he employed many
      peculiar expressions, more like a thief of a Parisian cabman than of the
      polite world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil he did!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Did he tell you why he
      wished to see the whole house? Did he contemplate taking rooms here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur, it appears that his interest was historical. At first
      I should not have taken him for a man of learning, yet he gave me a great
      piece of information; a thing quite new to me, though I have lived here so
      many years. We are distinguished in history, it seems, and at one time
      both William the Conqueror and that brave Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I interrupted sharply, dropping my cigar and leaning across the table:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was this person dressed?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, he was very much the pedestrian.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, for that evening, we had something to talk about besides &ldquo;that
      other monsieur&rdquo;; indeed, we found our subject so absorbing that I
      forgot to ask Amedee whether it was he or Jean Ferret who had prefixed the
      &ldquo;de&rdquo; to &ldquo;Armand.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The cat that fell from the top of the Washington monument, and scampered
      off unhurt was killed by a dog at the next corner. Thus a certain
      painter-man, winged with canvases and easel, might have been seen to
      depart hurriedly from a poppy-sprinkled field, an infuriated Norman
      stallion in close attendance, and to fly safely over a stone wall of good
      height, only to turn his ankle upon an unconsidered pebble, some ten paces
      farther on; the nose of the stallion projected over the wall, snorting joy
      thereat. The ankle was one which had turned aforetime; it was an old
      weakness: moreover, it was mine. I was the painter-man.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could count on little less than a week of idleness within the confines
      of Les Trois Pigeons; and reclining among cushions in a wicker long-chair
      looking out from my pavilion upon the drowsy garden on a hot noontide, I
      did not much care. It was cooler indoors, comfortable enough; the open
      door framed the courtyard where pigeons were strutting on the gravel walks
      between flower-beds. Beyond, and thrown deeper into the perspective by the
      outer frame of the great archway, road and fields and forest fringes were
      revealed, lying tremulously in the hot sunshine. The foreground gained a
      human (though not lively) interest from the ample figure of our maitre d&rsquo;hotel
      reposing in a rustic chair which had enjoyed the shade of an arbour about
      an hour earlier, when first occupied, but now stood in the broiling sun.
      At times Amedee&rsquo;s upper eyelids lifted as much as the sixteenth of
      an inch, and he made a hazy gesture as if to wave the sun away, or, when
      the table-cloth upon his left arm slid slowly earthward, he adjusted it
      with a petulant jerk, without material interruption to his siesta.
      Meanwhile Glouglou, rolling and smoking cigarettes in the shade of a clump
      of lilac, watched with button eyes the noddings of his superior, and, at
      the cost of some convulsive writhings, constrained himself to silent
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      A heavy step crunched the gravel and I heard my name pronounced in a deep
      inquiring rumble&mdash;the voice of Professor Keredec, no less. Nor was I
      greatly surprised, since our meeting in the forest had led me to expect
      some advances on his part toward friendliness, or, at least, in the
      direction of a better acquaintance. However, I withheld my reply for a
      moment to make sure I had heard aright.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name was repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; I called, &ldquo;in the pavilion, if you wish to
      see me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha! I hear you become an invalid, my dear sir.&rdquo; With that
      the professor&rsquo;s great bulk loomed in the doorway against the glare
      outside. &ldquo;I have come to condole with you, if you allow it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To smoke with me, too, I hope,&rdquo; I said, not a little pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I will do,&rdquo; he returned, and came in slowly, walking
      with perceptible lameness. &ldquo;The sympathy I offer is genuine: it is
      not only from the heart, it is from the latissimus dorsi&rdquo; he
      continued, seating himself with a cavernous groan. &ldquo;I am your
      confrere in illness, my dear sir. I have choosed this fine weather for
      rheumatism of the back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope it is not painful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, it is so-so,&rdquo; he rumbled, removing his spectacles and
      wiping his eyes, dazzled by the sun. &ldquo;There is more of me than of
      most men&mdash;more to suffer. Nature was generous to the little germs
      when she made this big Keredec; she offered them room for their campaigns
      of war.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take a cigarette?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you; if you do not mind, I smoke my pipe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He took from his pocket a worn leather case, which he opened, disclosing a
      small, browned clay bowl of the kind workmen use; and, fitting it with a
      red stem, he filled it with a dark and sinister tobacco from a pouch.
      &ldquo;Always my pipe for me,&rdquo; he said, and applied a match,
      inhaling the smoke as other men inhale the light smoke of cigarettes.
      &ldquo;Ha, it is good! It is wicked for the insides, but it is good for
      the soul.&rdquo; And clouds wreathed his great beard like a storm on Mont
      Blanc as he concluded, with gusto, &ldquo;It is my first pipe since
      yesterday.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is being a good smoker,&rdquo; I ventured sententiously;
      &ldquo;to whet indulgence with abstinence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; he protested, &ldquo;I am a man without even
      enough virtue to be an epicure. When I am alone I am a chimney with no
      hebdomadary repose; I smoke forever. It is on account of my young friend I
      am temperate now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has never smoked, your young friend?&rdquo; I asked, glancing at
      my visitor rather curiously, I fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Saffren has no vices.&rdquo; Professor Keredec replaced his
      silver-rimmed spectacles and turned them upon me with serene benevolence.
      &ldquo;He is in good condition, all pure, like little children&mdash;and
      so if I smoke near him he chokes and has water at the eyes, though he does
      not complain. Just now I take a vacation: it is his hour for study, but I
      think he looks more out of the front window than at his book. He looks
      very much from the window&rdquo;&mdash;there was a muttering of
      subterranean thunder somewhere, which I was able to locate in the
      professor&rsquo;s torso, and took to be his expression of a chuckle&mdash;&ldquo;yes,
      very much, since the passing of that charming lady some days ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say your young friend&rsquo;s name is Saffren?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oliver Saffren.&rdquo; The benevolent gaze continued to rest upon
      me, but a shadow like a faint anxiety darkened the Homeric brow, and an
      odd notion entered my mind (without any good reason) that Professor
      Keredec was wondering what I thought of the name. I uttered some
      commonplace syllable of no moment, and there ensued a pause during which
      the seeming shadow upon my visitor&rsquo;s forehead became a reality,
      deepening to a look of perplexity and trouble. Finally he said abruptly:
      &ldquo;It is about him that I have come to talk to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be very glad,&rdquo; I murmured, but he brushed the callow
      formality aside with a gesture of remonstrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, my dear sir,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;but you are a man of
      feeling! We are both old enough to deal with more than just these little
      words of the mouth! It was the way you have received my poor young
      gentleman&rsquo;s excuses when he was so rude, which make me wish to talk
      with you on such a subject; it is why I would not have you believe Mr.
      Saffren and me two very suspected individuals who hide here like two bad
      criminals!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; I protested hastily. &ldquo;The name of Professor
      Keredec&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The name of NO man,&rdquo; he thundered, interrupting, &ldquo;can
      protect his reputation when he is caught peeping from a curtain! Ha, my
      dear sir! I know what you think. You think, &lsquo;He is a nice fine man,
      that old professor, oh, very nice&mdash;only he hides behind the curtains
      sometimes! Very fine man, oh, yes; only he is a spy.&rsquo; Eh? Ha, ha!
      That is what you have been thinking, my dear sir!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; I laughed; &ldquo;I thought you might fear that
      <i>I</i> was a spy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; He became sharply serious upon the instant. &ldquo;What
      made you think that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I supposed you might be conducting some experiments, or perhaps
      writing a book which you wished to keep from the public for a time, and
      that possibly you might imagine that I was a reporter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So! And THAT is all,&rdquo; he returned, with evident relief.
      &ldquo;No, my dear sir, I was the spy; it is the truth; and I was spying
      upon you. I confess my shame. I wish very much to know what you were like,
      what kind of a man you are. And so,&rdquo; he concluded with an opening of
      the hands, palms upward, as if to show that nothing remained for
      concealment, &ldquo;and so I have watched you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The explanation is so simple: it was necessary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because of&mdash;of Mr. Saffren?&rdquo; I said slowly, and with
      some trepidation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo; The professor exhaled a cloud of smoke. &ldquo;Because
      I am sensitive for him, and because in a certain way I am&mdash;how should
      it be said?&mdash;perhaps it is near the truth to say, I am his guardian.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he rejoined quickly, &ldquo;but I am afraid you
      do not see. I am not his guardian by the law.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had not supposed that you were,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, though he puzzled me and I do not understand his case&mdash;his
      case, so to speak, I have not for a moment thought him insane.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, my dear sir, you are right!&rdquo; exclaimed Keredec, beaming
      on me, much pleased. &ldquo;You are a thousand times right; he is as sane
      as yourself or myself or as anybody in the whole wide world! Ha! he is now
      much MORE sane, for his mind is not yet confused and becobwebbed with the
      useless things you and I put into ours. It is open and clear like the
      little children&rsquo;s mind. And it is a good mind! It is only a little
      learning, a little experience, that he lacks. A few months more&mdash;ha,
      at the greatest, a year from now&mdash;and he will not be different any
      longer; he will be like the rest of us. Only&rdquo;&mdash;the professor
      leaned forward and his big fist came down on the arm of his chair&mdash;&ldquo;he
      shall be better than the rest of us! But if strange people were to see him
      now,&rdquo; he continued, leaning back and dropping his voice to a more
      confidential tone, &ldquo;it would not do. This poor world is full of
      fools; there are so many who judge quickly. If they should see him now,
      they might think he is not just right in his brain; and then, as it could
      happen so easily, those same people might meet him again after a while.
      &lsquo;Ha,&rsquo; they would say, &lsquo;there was a time when that young
      man was insane. I knew him!&rsquo; And so he might go through his life
      with those clouds over him. Those clouds are black clouds, they can make
      more harm than our old sins, and I wish to save my friend from them. So I
      have brought him here to this quiet place where nobody comes, and we can
      keep from meeting any foolish people. But, my dear sir&rdquo;&mdash;he
      leaned forward again, and spoke emphatically&mdash;&ldquo;it would be
      barbarous for men of intelligence to live in the same house and go always
      hiding from one another! Let us dine together this evening, if you will,
      and not only this evening but every evening you are willing to share with
      us and do not wish to be alone. It will be good for us. We are three men
      like hermits, far out of the world, but&mdash;a thousand saints!&mdash;let
      us be civilised to one another!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! I wish you to know my young man,&rdquo; Keredec went on.
      &ldquo;You will like him&mdash;no man of feeling could keep himself from
      liking him&mdash;and he is your fellow-countryman. I hope you will be his
      friend. He should make friends, for he needs them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he has a host of them,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;in Professor
      Keredec.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      My visitor looked at me quizzically for a moment, shook his head and
      sighed. &ldquo;That is only one small man in a big body, that Professor
      Keredec. And yet,&rdquo; he went on sadly, &ldquo;it is all the friends
      that poor boy has in this world. You will dine with us to-night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Acquiescing cheerfully, I added: &ldquo;You will join me at the table on
      my veranda, won&rsquo;t you? I can hobble that far but not much farther.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before answering he cast a sidelong glance at the arrangement of things
      outside the door. The screen of honeysuckle ran partly across the front of
      the little porch, about half of which it concealed from the garden and
      consequently from the road beyond the archway. I saw that he took note of
      this before he pointed to that corner of the veranda most closely screened
      by the vines and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May the table be placed yonder?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; I often have it there, even when I am alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, that is good,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;It is not human for a
      Frenchman to eat in the house in good weather.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a pity,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that I should have been such a
      bugbear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This remark was thoroughly disingenuous, for, although I did not doubt
      that anything he told me was perfectly true, nor that he had made as
      complete a revelation as he thought consistent with his duty toward the
      young man in his charge, I did not believe that his former precautions
      were altogether due to my presence at the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I was certain that while he might fear for his friend some chance
      repute of insanity, he had greater terrors than that. As to their nature I
      had no clew; nor was it my affair to be guessing; but whatever they were,
      the days of security at Les Trois Pigeons had somewhat eased Professor
      Keredec&rsquo;s mind in regard to them. At least, his anxiety was
      sufficiently assuaged to risk dining out of doors with only my screen of
      honeysuckle between his charge and curious eyes. So much was evident.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reproach is deserved,&rdquo; he returned, after a pause.
      &ldquo;It is to be wished that all our bugbears might offer as pleasant a
      revelation, if we had the courage, or the slyness&rdquo;&mdash;he laughed&mdash;&ldquo;to
      investigate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I made a reply of similar gallantry and he got to his feet, rubbing his
      back as he rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, I am old! old! Rheumatism in warm weather: that is ugly. Now I
      must go to my boy and see what he can make of his Gibbon. The poor fellow!
      I think he finds the decay of Rome worse than rheumatism in summer!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He replaced his pipe in its case, and promising heartily that it should
      not be the last he would smoke in my company and domain, was making slowly
      for the door when he paused at a sound from the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      We heard the rapid hoof-beats of a mettled horse. He crossed our vision
      and the open archway: a high-stepping hackney going well, driven by a lady
      in a light trap which was half full of wild flowers. It was a quick
      picture, like a flash of the cinematograph, but the pose of the lady as a
      driver was seen to be of a commanding grace, and though she was not in
      white but in light blue, and her plain sailor hat was certainly not
      trimmed with roses, I had not the least difficulty in recognising her. At
      the same instant there was a hurried clatter of foot-steps upon the
      stairway leading from the gallery; the startled pigeons fluttered up from
      the garden-path, betaking themselves to flight, and &ldquo;that other
      monsieur&rdquo; came leaping across the courtyard, through the archway and
      into the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glouglou! Look quickly!&rdquo; he called loudly, in French, as he
      came; &ldquo;Who is that lady?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Glouglou would have replied, but the words were taken out of his mouth.
      Amedee awoke with a frantic start and launched himself at the archway,
      carroming from its nearest corner and hurtling onward at a speed which for
      once did not diminish in proportion to his progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That lady, monsieur?&rdquo; he gasped, checking himself at the
      young man&rsquo;s side and gazing after the trap, &ldquo;that is Madame d&rsquo;Armand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame d&rsquo;Armand,&rdquo; Saffren repeated the name slowly.
      &ldquo;Her name is Madame d&rsquo;Armand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur,&rdquo; said Amedee complacently; &ldquo;it is an
      American lady who has married a French nobleman.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Like most painters, I have supposed the tools of my craft harder to
      manipulate than those of others. The use of words, particularly, seemed
      readier, handier for the contrivance of effects than pigments. I thought
      the language of words less elusive than that of colour, leaving smaller
      margin for unintended effects; and, believing in complacent good faith
      that words conveyed exact meanings exactly, it was my innocent conception
      that almost anything might be so described in words that all who read must
      inevitably perceive that thing precisely. If this were true, there would
      be little work for the lawyers, who produce such tortured pages in the
      struggle to be definite, who swing riches from one family to another, save
      men from violent death or send them to it, and earn fortunes for
      themselves through the dangerous inadequacies of words. I have learned how
      great was my mistake, and now I am wishing I could shift paper for canvas,
      that I might paint the young man who came to interest me so deeply. I wish
      I might present him here in colour instead of trusting to this unstable
      business of words, so wily and undependable, with their shimmering values,
      that you cannot turn your back upon them for two minutes but they will be
      shouting a hundred things which they were not meant to tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make the best of necessity: what I have written of him&mdash;my first
      impressions&mdash;must be taken as the picture, although it be but a
      gossamer sketch in the air, instead of definite work with well-ground
      pigments to show forth a portrait, to make you see flesh and blood. It
      must take the place of something contrived with my own tools to reveal
      what the following days revealed him to me, and what it was about him
      (evasive of description) which made me so soon, as Keredec wished, his
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life among our kin and kind is made pleasanter by our daily platitudes.
      Who is more tedious than the man incessantly struggling to avoid the
      banal? Nature rules that such a one will produce nothing better than
      epigram and paradox, saying old, old things in a new way, or merely
      shifting object for subject&mdash;and his wife&rsquo;s face, when he
      shines for a circle, is worth a glance. With no further apology, I declare
      that I am a person who has felt few positive likes or dislikes for people
      in this life, and I did deeply like my fellow-lodgers at Les Trois
      Pigeons. Liking for both men increased with acquaintance, and for the
      younger I came to feel, in addition, a kind of championship, doubtless in
      some measure due to what Keredec had told me of him, but more to that
      half-humourous sense of protectiveness that we always have for those young
      people whose untempered and innocent outlook makes us feel, as we say,
      &ldquo;a thousand years old.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon following our first dinner together, the two, in returning
      from their walk, came into the pavilion with cheerful greetings, instead
      of going to their rooms as usual, and Keredec, declaring that the open air
      had &ldquo;dispersed&rdquo; his rheumatism, asked if he might overhaul
      some of my little canvases and boards. I explained that they consisted
      mainly of &ldquo;notes&rdquo; for future use, but consented willingly;
      whereupon he arranged a number of them as for exhibition and delivered
      himself impromptu of the most vehemently instructive lecture on art I had
      ever heard. Beginning with the family, the tribe, and the totem-pole, he
      was able to demonstrate a theory that art was not only useful to society
      but its primary necessity; a curious thought, probably more attributable
      to the fact that he was a Frenchman than to that of his being a scientist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here,&rdquo; he said in the course of his demonstration,
      pointing to a sketch which I had made one morning just after sunrise&mdash;&ldquo;here
      you can see real sunshine. One certain day there came those few certain
      moment&rsquo; at the sunrise when the light was like this. Those few
      moment&rsquo;, where are they? They have disappeared, gone for eternally.
      They went&rdquo;&mdash;he snapped his fingers&mdash;&ldquo;like that. Yet
      here they are&mdash;ha!&mdash;forever!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t look like sunshine,&rdquo; said Oliver Saffren
      hesitatingly, stating a disconcerting but incontrovertible truth; &ldquo;it
      only seems to look like it because&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it because it&rsquo;s
      so much brighter than the rest of the picture? I doubt if paint CAN look
      like sunshine.&rdquo; He turned from the sketch, caught Keredec&rsquo;s
      gathering frown, and his face flushed painfully. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he
      cried, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have said it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I interposed to reassure him, exclaiming that it were a godsend indeed,
      did all our critics merely speak the plain truth as they see it for
      themselves. The professor would not have it so, and cut me off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no, my dear sir!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;You speak with
      kindness, but you put some wrong ideas in his head!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Saffren&rsquo;s look of trouble deepened. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo;
      he murmured. &ldquo;I thought you said always to speak the truth just as I
      see it.&rdquo; &ldquo;I have telled you,&rdquo; Keredec declared
      vehemently, &ldquo;nothing of the kind!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But only yesterday&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understood&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you understood only one-half! I say, &lsquo;Speak the truth as
      you see it, when you speak.&rsquo; I did not tell you to speak! How much
      time have you give&rsquo; to study sunshine and paint? What do you know
      about them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; answered the other humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A profound rumbling was heard, and the frown disappeared from Professor
      Keredec&rsquo;s brow like the vanishing of the shadow of a little cloud
      from the dome of some great benevolent and scientific institute. He
      dropped a weighty hand on his young friend&rsquo;s shoulder, and, in high
      good-humour, thundered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are a critic! Knowing nothing of sunshine except that it
      warms you, and never having touched paint, you are going to tell about
      them to a man who spends his life studying them! You look up in the night
      and the truth you see is that the moon and stars are crossing the ocean.
      You will tell that to the astronomer? Ha! The truth is what the masters
      see. When you know what they see, you may speak.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner the night before, it had struck me that Saffren was a rather
      silent young man by habit, and now I thought I began to understand the
      reason. I hinted as much, saying, &ldquo;That would make a quiet world of
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the better, my dear sir!&rdquo; The professor turned beamingly
      upon me and continued, dropping into a Whistlerian mannerism that he had
      sometimes: &ldquo;You must not blame that great wind of a Keredec for
      preaching at other people to listen. It gives the poor man more room for
      himself to talk!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I found his talk worth hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would show you, if I could, our pleasant evenings of lingering, after
      coffee, behind the tremulous screen of honeysuckle, with the night very
      dark and quiet beyond the warm nimbus of our candle-light, the faces of my
      two companions clear-obscure in a mellow shadow like the middle tones of a
      Rembrandt, and the professor, good man, talking wonderfully of everything
      under the stars and over them,&mdash;while Oliver Saffren and I sat under
      the spell of the big, kind voice, the young man listening with the same
      eagerness which marked him when he spoke. It was an eagerness to
      understand, not to interrupt.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were our evenings. In the afternoons the two went for their walk as
      usual, though now they did not plunge out of sight of the main road with
      the noticeable haste which Amedee had described. As time pressed, I
      perceived the caution of Keredec visibly slackening. Whatever he had
      feared, the obscurity and continued quiet of LES TROIS PIGEONS reassured
      him; he felt more and more secure in this sheltered retreat, &ldquo;far
      out of the world,&rdquo; and obviously thought no danger imminent. So the
      days went by, uneventful for my new friends,&mdash;days of warm idleness
      for me. Let them go unnarrated; we pass to the event.
    </p>
    <p>
      My ankle had taken its wonted time to recover. I was on my feet again and
      into the woods&mdash;not traversing, on the way, a certain poppy-sprinkled
      field whence a fine Norman stallion snorted ridicule over a wall. But the
      fortune of Keredec was to sink as I rose. His summer rheumatism returned,
      came to grips with him, laid him low. We hobbled together for a day or so,
      then I threw away my stick and he exchanged his for an improvised crutch.
      By the time I was fit to run, he was able to do little better than to
      creep&mdash;might well have taken to his bed. But as he insisted that his
      pupil should not forego the daily long walks and the health of the forest,
      it came to pass that Saffren often made me the objective of his rambles.
      At dinner he usually asked in what portion of the forest I should be
      painting late the next afternoon, and I got in the habit of expecting him
      to join me toward sunset. We located each other through a code of yodeling
      that we arranged; his part of these vocal gymnastics being very pleasant
      to hear, for he had a flexible, rich voice. I shudder to recall how
      largely my own performances partook of the grotesque. But in the forest
      where were no musical persons (I supposed) to take hurt from whatever
      noise I made, I would let go with all the lungs I had; he followed the
      horrid sounds to their origin, and we would return to the inn together.
    </p>
    <p>
      On these homeward walks I found him a good companion, and that is
      something not to be under-valued by a selfish man who lives for himself
      and his own little ways and his own little thoughts, and for very little
      else,&mdash;which is the kind of man (as I have already confessed) that I
      was&mdash;deserving the pity of all happily or unhappily married persons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Responsive in kind to either a talkative mood or a silent one, always
      gentle in manner, and always unobtrusively melancholy, Saffren never took
      the initiative, though now and then he asked a question about some rather
      simple matter which might be puzzling him. Whatever the answer, he usually
      received it in silence, apparently turning the thing over and over and
      inside out in his mind. He was almost tremulously sensitive, yet not vain,
      for he was neither afraid nor ashamed to expose his ignorance, his amazing
      lack of experience. He had a greater trouble, one that I had not fathomed.
      Sometimes there came over his face a look of importunate wistfulness and
      distressed perplexity, and he seemed on the point of breaking out with
      something that he wished to tell me&mdash;or to ask me, for it might have
      been a question&mdash;but he always kept it back. Keredec&rsquo;s training
      seldom lost its hold upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had gone back to my glade again, and to the thin sunshine, which came a
      little earlier, now that we were deep in July; and one afternoon I sat in
      the mouth of the path, just where I had played the bounding harlequin for
      the benefit of the lovely visitor at Quesnay. It was warm in the woods and
      quiet, warm with the heat of July, still with a July stillness. The leaves
      had no motion; if there were birds or insects within hearing they must
      have been asleep; the quivering flight of a butterfly in that languid air
      seemed, by contrast, quite a commotion; a humming-bird would have made a
      riot.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard the light snapping of a twig and a swish of branches from the
      direction in which I faced; evidently some one was approaching the glade,
      though concealed from me for the moment by the winding of the path. Taking
      it for Saffren, as a matter of course (for we had arranged to meet at that
      time and place), I raised my voice in what I intended for a merry yodel of
      greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I yodeled loud, I yodeled long. Knowing my own deficiencies in this art, I
      had adopted the cunning sinner&rsquo;s policy toward sin and made a joke
      of it: thus, since my best performance was not unsuggestive of calamity in
      the poultry yard, I made it worse. And then and there, when my mouth was
      at its widest in the production of these shocking ulla-hootings, the
      person approaching came round a turn in the path, and within full sight of
      me. To my ultimate, utmost horror, it was Madame d&rsquo;Armand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I grew so furiously red that it burned me. I had not the courage to run,
      though I could have prayed that she might take me for what I seemed&mdash;plainly
      a lunatic, whooping the lonely peace of the woods into pandemonium&mdash;and
      turn back. But she kept straight on, must inevitably reach the glade and
      cross it, and I calculated wretchedly that at the rate she was walking,
      unhurried but not lagging, it would be about thirty seconds before she
      passed me. Then suddenly, while I waited in sizzling shame, a clear voice
      rang out from a distance in an answering yodel to mine, and I thanked
      heaven for its mercies; at least she would see that my antics had some
      reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped short, in a half-step, as if a little startled, one arm raised
      to push away a thin green branch that crossed the path at shoulder-height;
      and her attitude was so charming as she paused, detained to listen by this
      other voice with its musical youthfulness, that for a second I thought
      crossly of all the young men in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a final call, clear and loud as a bugle, and she turned to the
      direction whence it came, so that her back was toward me. Then Oliver
      Saffren came running lightly round the turn of the path, near her and
      facing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped as short as she had.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hand dropped from the slender branch, and pressed against her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his hat and spoke to her, and I thought she made some quick
      reply in a low voice, though I could not be sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      She held that startled attitude a moment longer, then turned and crossed
      the glade so hurriedly that it was almost as if she ran away from him. I
      had moved aside with my easel and camp-stool, but she passed close to me
      as she entered the path again on my side of the glade. She did not seem to
      see me, her dark eyes stared widely straight ahead, her lips were parted,
      and she looked white and frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      She disappeared very quickly in the windings of the path.

      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      He came on more slowly, his eyes following her as she vanished, then
      turning to me with a rather pitiful apprehension&mdash;a look like that I
      remember to have seen (some hundreds of years ago) on the face of a
      freshman, glancing up from his book to find his doorway ominously filling
      with sophomores.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stepped out to meet him, indignant upon several counts, most of all upon
      his own. I knew there was no offence in his heart, not the remotest rude
      intent, but the fact was before me that he had frightened a woman, had
      given this very lovely guest of my friends good cause to hold him a boor,
      if she did not, indeed, think him (as she probably thought me) an outright
      lunatic! I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You spoke to that lady!&rdquo; And my voice sounded unexpectedly
      harsh and sharp to my own ears, for I had meant to speak quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know&mdash;I know. It&mdash;it was wrong,&rdquo; he stammered.
      &ldquo;I knew I shouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;and I couldn&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You expect me to believe that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the truth; I couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I laughed sceptically; and he flinched, but repeated that what he had said
      was only the truth. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand; it was all beyond me,&rdquo;
      he added huskily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it you said to her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I spoke her name&mdash;&lsquo;Madame d&rsquo;Armand.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said more than that!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked her if she would let me see her again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he answered humbly. &ldquo;And then she&mdash;then
      for a moment it seemed&mdash;for a moment she didn&rsquo;t seem to be able
      to speak&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think not!&rdquo; I shouted, and burst out at him with
      satirical laughter. He stood patiently enduring it, his lowered eyes
      following the aimless movements of his hands, which were twisting and
      untwisting his flexible straw hat; and it might have struck me as nearer
      akin to tragedy rather than to a thing for laughter: this spectacle of a
      grown man so like a schoolboy before the master, shamefaced over a
      stammered confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she did say something to you, didn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; I asked
      finally, with the gentleness of a cross-examining lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;after that moment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what was it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said, &lsquo;Not now!&rsquo; That was all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that was all she had breath for! It was just the
      inconsequent and meaningless thing a frightened woman WOULD say!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaningless?&rdquo; he repeated, and looked up wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you take it for an appointment?&rdquo; I roared, quite out of
      patience, and losing my temper completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no! She said only that, and then&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she turned and ran away from you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, swallowing painfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That PLEASED you,&rdquo; I stormed, &ldquo;to frighten a woman in
      the woods&mdash;to make her feel that she can&rsquo;t walk here in safety!
      You ENJOY doing things like that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me with disconcerting steadiness for a moment, and, without
      offering any other response, turned aside, resting his arm against the
      trunk of a tree and gazing into the quiet forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      I set about packing my traps, grumbling various sarcasms, the last
      mutterings of a departed storm, for already I realised that I had taken
      out my own mortification upon him, and I was stricken with remorse. And
      yet, so contrarily are we made, I continued to be unkind while in my heart
      I was asking pardon of him. I tried to make my reproaches gentler, to lend
      my voice a hint of friendly humour, but in spite of me the one sounded
      gruffer and the other sourer with everything I said. This was the worse
      because of the continued silence of the victim: he did not once answer,
      nor by the slightest movement alter his attitude until I had finished&mdash;and
      more than finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&mdash;and that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo; I said desperately, when
      the things were strapped and I had slung them to my shoulder. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
      be off, in heaven&rsquo;s name!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At that he turned quickly toward me; it did not lessen my remorse to see
      that he had grown very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have frightened her for the world,&rdquo; he said,
      and his voice and his whole body shook with a strange violence. &ldquo;I
      wouldn&rsquo;t have frightened her to please the angels in heaven!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A blunderer whose incantation had brought the spirit up to face me, I
      stared at him helplessly, nor could I find words to answer or control the
      passion that my imbecile scolding had evoked. Whatever the barriers
      Keredec&rsquo;s training had built for his protection, they were down now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think I told a lie!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You think I lied
      when I said I couldn&rsquo;t help speaking to her!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; I said earnestly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Words!&rdquo; he swept the feeble protest away, drowned in a
      whirling vehemence. &ldquo;And what does it matter? You CAN&rsquo;T
      understand. When YOU want to know what to do, you look back into your life
      and it tells you; and I look back&mdash;AH!&rdquo; He cried out, uttering
      a half-choked, incoherent syllable. &ldquo;I look back and it&rsquo;s all&mdash;BLIND!
      All these things you CAN do and CAN&rsquo;T do&mdash;all these infinite
      little things! You know, and Keredec knows, and Glouglou knows, and every
      mortal soul on earth knows&mdash;but <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t know! Your life
      has taught you, and you know, but I don&rsquo;t know. I haven&rsquo;t HAD
      my life. It&rsquo;s gone! All I have is words that Keredec has said to me,
      and it&rsquo;s like a man with no eyes, out in the sunshine hunting for
      the light. Do you think words can teach you to resist such impulses as I
      had when I spoke to Madame d&rsquo;Armand? Can life itself teach you to
      resist them? Perhaps you never had them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I answered honestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would burn my hand from my arm and my arm from my body,&rdquo; he
      went on, with the same wild intensity, &ldquo;rather than trouble her or
      frighten her, but I couldn&rsquo;t help speaking to her any more than I
      can help wanting to see her again&mdash;the feeling that I MUST&mdash;whatever
      you say or do, whatever Keredec says or does, whatever the whole world may
      say or do. And I will! It isn&rsquo;t a thing to choose to do, or not to
      do. I can&rsquo;t help it any more than I can help being alive!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, wiping from his brow a heavy dew not of the heat, but like that
      on the forehead of a man in crucial pain. I made nervous haste to seize
      the opportunity, and said gently, almost timidly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if it should distress the lady?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;then I could keep away. But I must know that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you might know it by her running away&mdash;and by her
      look,&rdquo; I said mildly. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;NO!&rdquo; And his eyes flashed an added emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s be on our way, or the
      professor will be wondering if he is to dine alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Without looking to see if he followed, I struck into the path toward home.
      He did follow, obediently enough, not uttering another word so long as we
      were in the woods, though I could hear him breathing sharply as he strode
      behind me, and knew that he was struggling to regain control of himself. I
      set the pace, making it as fast as I could, and neither of us spoke again
      until we had come out of the forest and were upon the main road near the
      Baudry cottage. Then he said in a steadier voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should it distress her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; I began, not slackening the pace &ldquo;there
      are formalities&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I know,&rdquo; he interrupted, with an impatient laugh. &ldquo;Keredec
      once took me to a marionette show&mdash;all the little people strung on
      wires; they couldn&rsquo;t move any other way. And so you mustn&rsquo;t
      talk to a woman until somebody whose name has been spoken to you speaks
      yours to her! Do you call that a rule of nature?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; I laughed in some desperation, &ldquo;we must
      conform to it, ordinarily, no matter whose rule it is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think Madame d&rsquo;Armand cares for little forms like
      that?&rdquo; he asked challengingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does,&rdquo; I assured him with perfect confidence. &ldquo;And,
      for the hundredth time, you must have seen how you troubled her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he returned, with the same curious obstinacy, &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t believe it. There was something, but it wasn&rsquo;t trouble.
      We looked straight at each other; I saw her eyes plainly, and it was&mdash;&rdquo;
      he paused and sighed, a sudden, brilliant smile upon his lips&mdash;&ldquo;it
      was very&mdash;it was very strange!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something so glad and different in his look that&mdash;like any
      other dried-up old blunderer in my place&mdash;I felt an instant tendency
      to laugh. It was that heathenish possession, the old insanity of the
      risibles, which makes a man think it a humourous thing that his friend
      should be discovered in love.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before I spoke, before I quite smiled outright, I was given the grace
      to see myself in the likeness of a leering stranger trespassing in some
      cherished inclosure: a garden where the gentlest guests must always be
      intruders, and only the owner should come. The best of us profane it
      readily, leaving the coarse prints of our heels upon its paths, mauling
      and man-handling the fairy blossoms with what pudgy fingers! Comes the
      poet, ruthlessly leaping the wall and trumpeting indecently his
      view-halloo of the chase, and, after him, the joker, snickering and
      hopeful of a kill among the rose-beds; for this has been their
      hunting-ground since the world began. These two have made us miserably
      ashamed of the divine infinitive, so that we are afraid to utter the very
      words &ldquo;to love,&rdquo; lest some urchin overhear and pursue us with
      a sticky forefinger and stickier taunts. It is little to my credit that I
      checked the silly impulse to giggle at the eternal marvel, and went as
      gently as I could where I should not have gone at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you were wrong,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;if it did distress
      her, and if it happened that she has already had too much that was
      distressing in her life&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know something about her!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You know&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not,&rdquo; I interrupted in turn. &ldquo;I have only a vague
      guess; I may be altogether mistaken.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it that you guess?&rdquo; he demanded abruptly. &ldquo;Who
      made her suffer?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it was her husband,&rdquo; I said, with a lack of
      discretion for which I was instantly sorry, fearing with reason that I had
      added a final blunder to the long list of the afternoon. &ldquo;That is,&rdquo;
      I added, &ldquo;if my guess is right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short in the road, detaining me by the arm, the question coming
      like a whip-crack: sharp, loud, violent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he alive?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I answered, beginning to move forward;
      &ldquo;and this is foolish talk&mdash;especially on my part!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I want to know,&rdquo; he persisted, again detaining me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I DON&rsquo;T know!&rdquo; I returned emphatically. &ldquo;Probably
      I am entirely mistaken in thinking that I know anything of her whatever. I
      ought not to have spoken, unless I knew what I was talking about, and I&rsquo;d
      rather not say any more until I do know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said quickly. &ldquo;Will you tell me then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;if you will let it go at that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said, and with an impulse which was but too
      plainly one of gratitude, offered me his hand. I took it, and my soul was
      disquieted within me, for it was no purpose of mine to set inquiries on
      foot in regard to the affairs of &ldquo;Madame d&rsquo;Armand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was early dusk, that hour, a little silvered but still clear, when the
      edges of things are beginning to grow indefinite, and usually our sleepy
      countryside knew no tranquiller time of day; but to-night, as we
      approached the inn, there were strange shapes in the roadway and other
      tokens that events were stirring there.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the courtyard came the sounds of laughter and chattering voices.
      Before the entrance stood a couple of open touring-cars; the chauffeurs
      engaged in cooling the rear tires with buckets of water brought by a
      personage ordinarily known as Glouglou, whose look and manner, as he
      performed this office for the leathern dignitaries, so awed me that I
      wondered I had ever dared address him with any presumption of intimacy.
      The cars were great and opulent, of impressive wheel-base, and
      fore-and-aft they were laden intricately with baggage: concave trunks
      fitting behind the tonneaus, thin trunks fastened upon the footboards,
      green, circular trunks adjusted to the spare tires, all deeply coated with
      dust. Here were fineries from Paris, doubtless on their way to flutter
      over the gay sands of Trouville, and now wandering but temporarily from
      the road; for such splendours were never designed to dazzle us of Madame
      Brossard&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were crossing before the machines when one of the drivers saw fit to
      crank his engine (if that is the knowing phrase) and the thing shook out
      the usual vibrating uproar. It had a devastating effect upon my companion.
      He uttered a wild exclamation and sprang sideways into me, almost
      upsetting us both.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth is the matter?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Did you think
      the car was starting?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned toward me a face upon which was imprinted the sheer, blank
      terror of a child. It passed in an instant however, and he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really didn&rsquo;t know. Everything has been so quiet always,
      out here in the country&mdash;and that horrible racket coming so suddenly&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Laughing with him, I took his arm and we turned to enter the archway. As
      we did so we almost ran into a tall man who was coming out, evidently
      intending to speak to one of the drivers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger stepped back with a word of apology, and I took note of him
      for a fellow-countryman, and a worldly buck of fashion indeed, almost as
      cap-a-pie the automobilist as my mysterious spiller of cider had been the
      pedestrian. But this was no game-chicken; on the contrary (so far as a
      glance in the dusk of the archway revealed him), much the picture for
      framing in a club window of a Sunday morning; a seasoned, hard-surfaced,
      knowing creature for whom many a head waiter must have swept previous
      claimants from desired tables. He looked forty years so cannily that I
      guessed him to be about fifty.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were passing him when he uttered an ejaculation of surprise and stepped
      forward again, holding out his hand to my companion, and exclaiming:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did YOU come from? I&rsquo;d hardly have known you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver seemed unconscious of the proffered hand; he stiffened visibly and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think there must be some mistake.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So there is,&rdquo; said the other promptly. &ldquo;I have been
      misled by a resemblance. I beg your pardon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his cap slightly, going on, and we entered the courtyard to find
      a cheerful party of nine or ten men and women seated about a couple of
      tables. Like the person we had just encountered, they all exhibited a
      picturesque elaboration of the costume permitted by their mode of travel;
      making effective groupings in their ample draperies of buff and green and
      white, with glimpses of a flushed and pretty face or two among the
      loosened veilings. Upon the tables were pots of tea, plates of sandwiches,
      Madame Brossard&rsquo;s three best silver dishes heaped with fruit, and
      some bottles of dry champagne from the cellars of Rheims. The partakers
      were making very merry, having with them (as is inevitable in all such
      parties, it seems) a fat young man inclined to humour, who was now upon
      his feet for the proposal of some prankish toast. He interrupted himself
      long enough to glance our way as we crossed the garden; and it struck me
      that several pairs of brighter eyes followed my young companion with
      interest. He was well worth it, perhaps all the more because he was so
      genuinely unconscious of it; and he ran up the gallery steps and
      disappeared into his own rooms without sending even a glance from the
      corner of his eye in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went almost as quickly to my pavilion, and, without lighting my lamp,
      set about my preparations for dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party outside, breaking up presently, could be heard moving toward the
      archway with increased noise and laughter, inspired by some exquisite
      antic on the part of the fat young man, when a girl&rsquo;s voice (a very
      attractive voice) called, &ldquo;Oh, Cressie, aren&rsquo;t you coming?&rdquo;
      and a man&rsquo;s replied, from near my veranda: &ldquo;Only stopping to
      light a cigar.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A flutter of skirts and a patter of feet betokened that the girl came
      running back to join the smoker. &ldquo;Cressie,&rdquo; I heard her say in
      an eager, lowered tone, &ldquo;who WAS he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was who?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That DEVASTATING creature in white flannels!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man chuckled. &ldquo;Matinee sort of devastator&mdash;what? Monte
      Cristo hair, noble profile&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better tell me,&rdquo; she interrupted earnestly&mdash;&ldquo;if
      you don&rsquo;t want me to ask the WAITER.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw you speak to him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it was a man I met three years ago out in San Francisco,
      but I was mistaken. There was a slight resemblance. This fellow might have
      been a rather decent younger brother of the man I knew. HE was the&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      My strong impression was that if the speaker had not been interrupted at
      this point he would have said something very unfavourable to the character
      of the man he had met in San Francisco; but there came a series of blasts
      from the automobile horns and loud calls from others of the party, who
      were evidently waiting for these two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coming!&rdquo; shouted the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; said his companion hurriedly, &ldquo;Who was the other
      man, the older one with the painting things and SUCH a coat?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never saw him before in my life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I caught a last word from the girl as the pair moved away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come back here with a BAND to-morrow night, and serenade
      the beautiful one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;d drop me his card out of the window!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The horns sounded again; there was a final chorus of laughter, suddenly
      ceasing to be heard as the cars swept away, and Les Trois Pigeons was left
      to its accustomed quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur is served,&rdquo; said Amedee, looking in at my door, five
      minutes later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have passed a great hour just now, Amedee.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was like the old days, truly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are off for Trouville, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur, they are on their way to visit the chateau, and
      stopped here only because the run from Paris had made the tires too hot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To visit Quesnay, you mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly. But monsieur need give himself no uneasiness; I did not
      mention to any one that monsieur is here. His name was not spoken.
      Mademoiselle Ward returned to the chateau to-day,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;She
      has been in England.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quesnay will be gay,&rdquo; I said, coming out to the table. Oliver
      Saffren was helping the professor down the steps, and Keredec, bent with
      suffering, but indomitable, gave me a hearty greeting, and began a
      ruthless dissection of Plato with the soup. Oliver, usually, very quiet,
      as I have said, seemed a little restless under the discourse to-night.
      However, he did not interrupt, sitting patiently until bedtime, though
      obviously not listening. When he bade me good night he gave me a look so
      clearly in reference to a secret understanding between us that, meaning to
      keep only the letter of my promise to him, I felt about as comfortable as
      if I had meanly tricked a child.

      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      I had finished dressing, next morning, and was strapping my things
      together for the day&rsquo;s campaign, when I heard a shuffling step upon
      the porch, and the door opened gently, without any previous ceremony of
      knocking. To my angle of vision what at first appeared to have opened it
      was a tray of coffee, rolls, eggs, and a packet of sandwiches, but, after
      hesitating somewhat, this apparition advanced farther into the room,
      disclosing a pair of supporting hands, followed in due time by the whole
      person of a nervously smiling and visibly apprehensive Amedee. He closed
      the door behind him by the simple action of backing against it, took the
      cloth from his arm, and with a single gesture spread it neatly upon a
      small table, then, turning to me, laid the forefinger of his right hand
      warningly upon his lips and bowed me a deferential invitation to occupy
      the chair beside the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, glaring at him, &ldquo;what ails you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought monsieur might prefer his breakfast indoors, this
      morning,&rdquo; he returned in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The miserable old man said something I did not understand&mdash;an
      incoherent syllable or two&mdash;suddenly covered his mouth with both
      hands, and turned away. I heard a catch in his throat; suffocated sounds
      issued from his bosom; however, it was nothing more than a momentary
      seizure, and, recovering command of himself by a powerful effort, he faced
      me with hypocritical servility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you laugh?&rdquo; I asked indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I did not laugh,&rdquo; he replied in a husky whisper. &ldquo;Not
      at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did,&rdquo; I asserted, raising my voice. &ldquo;It almost
      killed you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; he begged hoarsely, &ldquo;HUSH!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; I demanded loudly. &ldquo;What do you
      mean by these abominable croakings? Speak out!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur&mdash;&rdquo; he gesticulated in a panic, toward the
      courtyard. &ldquo;Mademoiselle Ward is out there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WHAT!&rdquo; But I did not shout the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is always a little window in the rear wall,&rdquo; he
      breathed in my ear as I dropped into the chair by the table. &ldquo;She
      would not see you if&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I interrupted with all the French rough-and-ready expressions of dislike
      at my command, daring to hope that they might give him some shadowy,
      far-away idea of what I thought of both himself and his suggestions, and,
      notwithstanding the difficulty of expressing strong feeling in whispers,
      it seemed to me that, in a measure, I succeeded. &ldquo;I am not in the
      habit of crawling out of ventilators,&rdquo; I added, subduing a tendency
      to vehemence. &ldquo;And probably Mademoiselle Ward has only come to talk
      with Madame Brossard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear some of those people may have told her you were here,&rdquo;
      he ventured insinuatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What people?&rdquo; I asked, drinking my coffee calmly, yet, it
      must be confessed, without quite the deliberation I could have wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those who stopped yesterday evening on the way to the chateau. They
      might have recognised&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible. I knew none of them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Mademoiselle Ward knows that you are here. Without doubt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because she has inquired for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So!&rdquo; I rose at once and went toward the door. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t
      you tell me at once?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely,&rdquo; he remonstrated, ignoring my question, &ldquo;monsieur
      will make some change of attire?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Change of attire?&rdquo; I echoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, the poor old coat all hunched at the shoulders and spotted with
      paint!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t it be?&rdquo; I hissed, thoroughly irritated.
      &ldquo;Do you take me for a racing marquis?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But monsieur has a coat much more as a coat ought to be. And Jean
      Ferret says&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, now we&rsquo;re getting at it!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;What does
      Jean Ferret say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it would be better if I did not repeat&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out with it! What does Jean Ferret say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, Mademoiselle Ward&rsquo;s maid from Paris has told Jean
      Ferret that monsieur and Mademoiselle Ward have corresponded for years,
      and that&mdash;and that&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; I bade him ominously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That monsieur has sent Mademoiselle Ward many expensive jewels, and&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; said I, at which he paused abruptly, and stood staring
      at me. The idea of explaining Miss Elizabeth&rsquo;s collection to him, of
      getting anything whatever through that complacent head of his, was so
      hopeless that I did not even consider it. There was only one thing to do,
      and perhaps I should have done it&mdash;I do not know, for he saw the
      menace coiling in my eye, and hurriedly retreated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur!&rdquo; he gasped, backing away from me, and as his hand,
      fumbling behind him, found the latch of the door, he opened it, and
      scrambled out by a sort of spiral movement round the casing. When I
      followed, a moment later&mdash;with my traps on my shoulder and the packet
      of sandwiches in my pocket&mdash;he was out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Elizabeth sat beneath the arbour at the other end of the courtyard,
      and beside her stood the trim and glossy bay saddle-horse that she had
      ridden from Quesnay, his head outstretched above his mistress to paddle at
      the vine leaves with a tremulous upper lip. She checked his desire with a
      slight movement of her hand upon the bridle-rein; and he arched his neck
      prettily, pawing the gravel with a neat forefoot. Miss Elizabeth is one of
      the few large women I have known to whom a riding-habit is entirely
      becoming, and this group of two&mdash;a handsome woman and her handsome
      horse&mdash;has had a charm for all men ever since horses were tamed and
      women began to be beautiful. I thought of my work, of the canvases I meant
      to cover, but I felt the charm&mdash;and I felt it stirringly. It was a
      fine, fresh morning, and the sun just risen.
    </p>
    <p>
      An expression in the lady&rsquo;s attitude, and air which I instinctively
      construed as histrionic, seemed intended to convey that she had been kept
      waiting, yet had waited without reproach; and although she must have heard
      me coming, she did not look toward me until I was quite near and spoke her
      name. At that she sprang up quickly enough, and stretched out her hand to
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run to earth!&rdquo; she cried, advancing a step to meet me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pretty poor trophy of the chase,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but proud
      that you are its killer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To my surprise and mystification, her cheeks and brow flushed rosily; she
      was obviously conscious of it, and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be embarrassed,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;I!&rdquo;
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you, poor man! I suppose I couldn&rsquo;t have more thoroughly
      compromised you. Madame Brossard will never believe in your respectability
      again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, she will,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? A lodger who has ladies calling upon him at five o&rsquo;clock
      in the morning? But your bundle&rsquo;s on your shoulder,&rdquo; she
      rattled on, laughing, &ldquo;though there&rsquo;s many could be bolder,
      and perhaps you&rsquo;ll let me walk a bit of the way with you, if you&rsquo;re
      for the road.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I will,&rdquo; said I. She caught up her riding-skirt,
      fastening it by a clasp at her side, and we passed out through the archway
      and went slowly along the road bordering the forest, her horse following
      obediently at half-rein&rsquo;s length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you hear that I was at Madame Brossard&rsquo;s?&rdquo; I
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten minutes after I returned to Quesnay, late yesterday afternoon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Louise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I repeated the name questioningly. &ldquo;You mean Mrs. Larrabee Harman?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Louise Harman,&rdquo; she corrected. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know
      she was staying at Quesnay?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guessed it, though Amedee got the name confused.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s been kind enough to look after the place for us
      while we were away. George won&rsquo;t be back for another ten days, and I&rsquo;ve
      been overseeing an exhibition for him in London. Afterward I did a round
      of visits&mdash;tiresome enough, but among people it&rsquo;s well to keep
      in touch with on George&rsquo;s account.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; I said, with a grimness which probably escaped her.
      &ldquo;But how did Mrs. Harman know that I was at Les Trois Pigeons?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She met you once in the forest&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twice,&rdquo; I interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She mentioned only once. Of course she&rsquo;d often heard both
      George and me speak of you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how did she know it was I and where I was staying?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that?&rdquo; Her smile changed to a laugh. &ldquo;Your maitre d&rsquo;hotel
      told Ferret, a gardener at Quesnay, that you were at the inn.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but you mustn&rsquo;t be angry with him; he made it quite all
      right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he do that?&rdquo; I asked, trying to speak calmly, though
      there was that in my mind which might have blanched the parchment cheek of
      a grand inquisitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told Ferret that you were very anxious not to have it known&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You call that making it all right?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For himself, I mean. He asked Ferret not to mention who it was that
      told him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rascal!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;The treacherous, brazen&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunate man,&rdquo; said Miss Elizabeth, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you
      see how clear you&rsquo;re making it that you really meant to hide from
      us?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There seemed to be something in that, and my tirade broke up in confusion.
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; I said lamely, &ldquo;I hoped&mdash;I hoped&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be careful!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I hoped to work down here,&rdquo; I blurted. &ldquo;And I
      thought if I saw too much of you&mdash;I might not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at me with widening eyes. &ldquo;And I can take my choice,&rdquo;
      she cried, &ldquo;of all the different things you may mean by that! It&rsquo;s
      either the most outrageous speech I ever heard&mdash;or the most
      flattering.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I meant simply&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; She lifted her hand and stopped me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
      rather believe that I have at least the choice&mdash;and let it go at
      that.&rdquo; And as I began to laugh, she turned to me with a gravity
      apparently so genuine that for the moment I was fatuous enough to believe
      that she had said it seriously. Ensued a pause of some duration, which,
      for my part, I found disturbing. She broke it with a change of subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think Louise very lovely to look at, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exquisite,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one does.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose she told you&mdash;&rdquo; and now I felt myself growing
      red&mdash;&ldquo;that I behaved like a drunken acrobat when she came upon
      me in the path.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Did you?&rdquo; cried Miss Elizabeth, with a ready credulity
      which I thought by no means pretty; indeed, she seemed amused and, to my
      surprise (for she is not an unkind woman), rather heartlessly pleased.
      &ldquo;Louise only said she knew it must be you, and that she wished she
      could have had a better look at what you were painting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven bless her!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Her reticence was
      angelic.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she has reticence,&rdquo; said my companion, with enough of
      the same quality to make me look at her quickly. A thin line had been
      drawn across her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean she&rsquo;s still reticent with George?&rdquo; I ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered sadly. &ldquo;Poor George always hopes, of
      course, in the silent way of his kind when they suffer from such
      unfortunate passions&mdash;and he waits.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that former husband of hers recovered?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe he&rsquo;s still alive somewhere. Locked up, I hope!&rdquo;
      she finished crisply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She retained his name,&rdquo; I observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harman? Yes, she retained it,&rdquo; said my companion rather
      shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events, she&rsquo;s rid of him, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s RID of him!&rdquo; Her tone implied an enigmatic
      reservation of some kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard,&rdquo; I reflected aloud, &ldquo;hard to
      understand her making that mistake, young as she was. Even in the glimpses
      of her I&rsquo;ve had, it was easy to see something of what she&rsquo;s
      like: a fine, rare, high type&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t know HIM, did you?&rdquo; Miss Elizabeth asked
      with some dryness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;I saw him twice; once at the time of
      his accident&mdash;that was only a nightmare, his face covered with&mdash;&rdquo;
      I shivered. &ldquo;But I had caught a glimpse of him on the boulevard, and
      of all the dreadful&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but he wasn&rsquo;t always dreadful,&rdquo; she interposed
      quickly. &ldquo;He was a fascinating sort of person, quite charming and
      good-looking, when she ran away with him, though he was horribly
      dissipated even then. He always had been THAT. Of course she thought she&rsquo;d
      be able to straighten him out&mdash;poor girl! She tried, for three years&mdash;three
      years it hurts one to think of! You see it must have been something very
      like a &lsquo;grand passion&rsquo; to hold her through a pain three years
      long.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or tremendous pride,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Women make an odd world
      of it for the rest of us. There was good old George, as true and straight
      a man as ever lived&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she took the other! Yes.&rdquo; George&rsquo;s sister laughed
      sorrowfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But George and she have both survived the mistake,&rdquo; I went on
      with confidence. &ldquo;Her tragedy must have taught her some important
      differences. Haven&rsquo;t you a notion she&rsquo;ll be tremendously glad
      to see him when he comes back from America?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I do hope so!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;m
      fearing that he hopes so too&mdash;to the degree of counting on it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t count on it yourself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. &ldquo;With any other woman I should.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not with Mrs. Harman?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cousin Louise has her ways,&rdquo; said Miss Elizabeth slowly, and,
      whether she could not further explain her doubts, or whether she would
      not, that was all I got out of her on the subject at the time. I asked one
      or two more questions, but my companion merely shook her head again,
      alluding vaguely to her cousin&rsquo;s &ldquo;ways.&rdquo; Then she
      brightened suddenly, and inquired when I would have my things sent up to
      the chateau from the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the risk of a misunderstanding which I felt I could ill afford, I
      resisted her kind hospitality, and the outcome of it was that there should
      be a kind of armistice, to begin with my dining at the chateau that
      evening. Thereupon she mounted to the saddle, a bit of gymnastics for
      which she declined my assistance, and looked down upon me from a great
      height.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did anybody ever tell you,&rdquo; was her surprising inquiry,
      &ldquo;that you are the queerest man of these times?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;re a
      queerer woman?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;FOOTLE!&rdquo; she cried scornfully. &ldquo;Be off to your woods
      and your woodscaping!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The bay horse departed at a smart gait, not, I was glad to see, a parkish
      trot&mdash;Miss Elizabeth wisely set limits to her sacrifices to Mode&mdash;and
      she was far down the road before I had passed the outer fringe of trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      My work was accomplished after a fashion more or less desultory that day;
      I had many absent moments, was restless, and walked more than I painted.
      Oliver Saffron did not join me in the late afternoon; nor did the echo of
      distant yodelling bespeak any effort on his part to find me. So I gave him
      up, and returned to the inn earlier than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      While dressing I sent word to Professor Keredec that I should not be able
      to join him at dinner that evening; and it is to be recorded that Glouglou
      carried the message for me. Amedee did not appear, from which it may be
      inferred that our maitre d&rsquo;hotel was subject to lucid intervals.
      Certainly his present shyness indicated an intelligence of no low order.

      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      The dining-room at Quesnay is a pretty work of the second of those three
      Louises who made so much furniture. It was never a proper setting for a
      rusty, out-of-doors painter-man, nor has such a fellow ever found himself
      complacently at ease there since the day its first banquet was spread for
      a score or so of fine-feathered epigram jinglers, fiddling Versailles
      gossip out of a rouge-and-lace Quesnay marquise newly sent into
      half-earnest banishment for too much king-hunting. For my part, however, I
      should have preferred a chance at making a place for myself among the wigs
      and brocades to the Crusoe&rsquo;s Isle of my chair at Miss Elizabeth&rsquo;s
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      I learned at an early age to look my vanities in the face; I outfaced them
      and they quailed, but persisted, surviving for my discomfort to this day.
      Here is the confession: It was not until my arrival at the chateau that I
      realised what temerity it involved to dine there in evening clothes
      purchased, some four or five or six years previously, in the economical
      neighbourhood of the Boulevard St. Michel. Yet the things fitted me well
      enough; were clean and not shiny, having been worn no more than a dozen
      times, I think; though they might have been better pressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking over the men of the Quesnay party&mdash;or perhaps I should
      signify a reversal of that and say a glance of theirs at me&mdash;revealed
      the importance of a particular length of coat-tail, of a certain rich
      effect obtained by widely separating the lower points of the waistcoat, of
      the display of some imagination in the buttons upon the same garment, of a
      doubled-back arrangement of cuffs, and of a specific design and dimension
      of tie. Marked uniformity in these matters denoted their necessity; and
      clothes differing from the essential so vitally as did mine must have
      seemed immodest, little better than no clothes at all. I doubt if I could
      have argued in extenuation my lack of advantages for study, such an excuse
      being itself the damning circumstance. Of course eccentricity is
      permitted, but (as in the Arts) only to the established. And I recall a
      painful change of colour which befell the countenance of a shining young
      man I met at Ward&rsquo;s house in Paris: he had used his handkerchief and
      was absently putting it in his pocket when he providentially noticed what
      he was doing and restored it to his sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Elizabeth had the courage to take me under her wing, placing me upon
      her left at dinner; but sprightlier calls than mine demanded and occupied
      her attention. At my other side sat a magnificently upholstered lady, who
      offered a fine shoulder and the rear wall of a collar of pearls for my
      observation throughout the evening, as she leaned forward talking eagerly
      with a male personage across the table. This was a prince, ending in
      &ldquo;ski&rdquo;: he permitted himself the slight vagary of wearing a
      gold bracelet, and perhaps this flavour of romance drew the lady. Had my
      good fortune ever granted a second meeting, I should not have known her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fragments reaching me in my seclusion indicated that the various
      conversations up and down the long table were animated; and at times some
      topic proved of such high interest as to engage the comment of the whole
      company. This was the case when the age of one of the English king&rsquo;s
      grandchildren came in question, but a subject which called for even longer
      (if less spirited) discourse concerned the shameful lack of standard on
      the part of citizens of the United States, or, as it was put, with no
      little exasperation, &ldquo;What is the trouble with America?&rdquo;
      Hereupon brightly gleamed the fat young man whom I had marked for a wit at
      Les Trois Pigeons; he pictured with inimitable mimicry a western senator
      lately in France. This outcast, it appeared, had worn a slouch hat at a
      garden party and had otherwise betrayed his country to the ridicule of the
      intelligent. &ldquo;But really,&rdquo; said the fat young man, turning
      plaintiff in conclusion, &ldquo;imagine what such things make the English
      and the French think of US!&rdquo; And it finally went by consent that the
      trouble with America was the vulgarity of our tourists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dreadful lot!&rdquo; Miss Elizabeth cheerfully summed up for them
      all. &ldquo;The miseries I undergo with that class of &lsquo;prominent
      Amurricans&rsquo; who bring letters to my brother! I remember one awful
      creature who said, when I came into the room, &lsquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am, I
      guess you&rsquo;re the lady of the house, aren&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Elizabeth sparkled through the chorus of laughter, but I remembered
      the &ldquo;awful creature,&rdquo; a genial and wise old man of affairs,
      whose daughter&rsquo;s portrait George painted. Miss Elizabeth had missed
      his point: the canvasser&rsquo;s phrase had been intended with humour, and
      even had it lacked that, it was not without a pretty quaintness. So I
      thought, being &ldquo;left to my own reflections,&rdquo; which may have
      partaken of my own special kind of snobbery; at least I regretted the
      Elizabeth of the morning garden and the early walk along the fringe of the
      woods. For she at my side to-night was another lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      The banquet was drawing to a close when she leaned toward me and spoke in
      an undertone. As this was the first sign, in so protracted a period, that
      I might ever again establish relations with the world of men, it came upon
      me like a Friday&rsquo;s footprint, and in the moment of shock I did not
      catch what she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne Elliott, yonder, is asking you a question,&rdquo; she
      repeated, nodding at a very pretty gal down and across the table from me.
      Miss Anne Elliott&rsquo;s attractive voice had previously enabled me to
      recognise her as the young woman who had threatened to serenade Les Trois
      Pigeons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; I said, addressing her, and at the sound
      my obscurity was illuminated, about half of the company turning to look at
      me with wide-eyed surprise. (I spoke in an ordinary tone, it may need to
      be explained, and there is nothing remarkable about my voice).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear you&rsquo;re at Les Trois Pigeons,&rdquo; said Miss Elliott.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WOULD you mind telling us something of the MYSTERIOUS Narcissus?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll be more definite,&rdquo; I returned, in the tone of
      a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There couldn&rsquo;t be more than one like THAT,&rdquo; said Miss
      Elliott, &ldquo;at least, not in one neighbourhood, could there? I mean a
      RECKLESSLY charming vision with a WHITE tie and WHITE hair and WHITE
      flannels.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;HE&rsquo;S not mysterious.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he IS,&rdquo; she returned; &ldquo;I insist on his being
      MYSTERIOUS! Rarely, grandly, STRANGELY mysterious! You WILL let me think
      so?&rdquo; This young lady had a whimsical manner of emphasising words
      unexpectedly, with a breathless intensity that approached violence, a
      habit dangerously contagious among nervous persons, so that I answered
      slowly, out of a fear that I might echo it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would need a great deal of imagination. He&rsquo;s a young
      American, very attractive, very simple&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s MAD!&rdquo; she interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; I said hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he IS! A person told me so in a garden this VERY afternoon,&rdquo;
      she went on eagerly; &ldquo;a person with a rake and EVER so many moles on
      his chin. This person told me all about him. His name is Oliver Saffren,
      and he&rsquo;s in the charge of a VERY large doctor and quite, QUITE mad!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jean Ferret, the gardener.&rdquo; I said deliberately, and with
      venom, &ldquo;is fast acquiring notoriety in these parts as an idiot of
      purest ray, and he had his information from another whose continuance
      unhanged is every hour more miraculous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How RUTHLESS of you,&rdquo; cried Miss Elliott, with exaggerated
      reproach, &ldquo;when I have had such a thrilling happiness all day in
      believing that RIOTOUSLY beautiful creature mad! You are wholly positive
      he isn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Our dialogue was now all that delayed a general departure from the table.
      This, combined with the naive surprise I have mentioned, served to make us
      temporarily the centre of attention, and, among the faces turned toward
      me, my glance fell unexpectedly upon one I had not seen since entering the
      dining-room. Mrs. Harman had been placed at some distance from me and on
      the same side of the table, but now she leaned far back in her chair to
      look at me, so that I saw her behind the shoulders of the people between
      us. She was watching me with an expression unmistakably of repressed
      anxiety and excitement, and as our eyes met, hers shone with a certain
      agitation, as of some odd consciousness shared with me. It was so
      strangely, suddenly a reminder of the look of secret understanding given
      me with good night, twenty-four hours earlier, by the man whose sanity was
      Miss Elliott&rsquo;s topic, that, puzzled and almost disconcerted for the
      moment, I did not at once reply to the lively young lady&rsquo;s question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re hesitating!&rdquo; she cried, clasping her hands.
      &ldquo;I believe there&rsquo;s a DARLING little chance of it, after all!
      And if it weren&rsquo;t so, why would he need to be watched over, day AND
      night, by an ENORMOUS doctor?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This IS romance!&rdquo; I retorted. &ldquo;The doctor is Professor
      Keredec, illustriously known in this country, but not as a physician, and
      they are following some form of scientific research together, I believe.
      But, assuming to speak as Mr. Saffren&rsquo;s friend,&rdquo; I added,
      rising with the others upon Miss Ward&rsquo;s example, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      sure if he could come to know of your interest, he would much rather play
      Hamlet for you than let you find him disappointing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he could come to know of my interest!&rdquo; she echoed,
      glancing down at herself with mock demureness. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
      think he could come to know something more of me than that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The windows had been thrown open, allowing passage to a veranda. Miss
      Elizabeth led the way outdoors with the prince, the rest of us following
      at hazard, and in the mild confusion of this withdrawal I caught a final
      glimpse of Mrs. Harman, which revealed that she was still looking at me
      with the same tensity; but with the movement of intervening groups I lost
      her. Miss Elliott pointedly waited for me until I came round the table,
      attached me definitely by taking my arm, accompanying her action with a
      dazzling smile. &ldquo;Oh, DO you think you can manage it?&rdquo; she
      whispered rapturously, to which I replied&mdash;as vaguely as I could&mdash;that
      the demands of scientific research upon the time of its followers were apt
      to be exorbitant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tables and coffee were waiting on the broad terrace below, with a big moon
      rising in the sky. I descended the steps in charge of this pretty
      cavalier, allowed her to seat me at the most remote of the tables, and
      accepted without unwillingness other gallantries of hers in the matter of
      coffee and cigarettes. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;now that I&rsquo;ve
      done so much for your DEAREST hopes and comfort, look up at the milky
      moon, and tell me ALL!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can bear it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned an elbow on the marble railing that protected the terrace, and,
      shielding her eyes from the moonlight with her hand, affected to gaze at
      me dramatically. &ldquo;Have no distrust,&rdquo; she bade me. &ldquo;Who
      and WHAT is the glorious stranger?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Resisting an impulse to chime in with her humour, I gave her so dry and
      commonplace an account of my young friend at the inn that I presently
      found myself abandoned to solitude again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where to go,&rdquo; she complained as she rose.
      &ldquo;These other people are MOST painful to a girl of my intelligence,
      but I cannot linger by your side; untruth long ago lost its interest for
      me, and I prefer to believe Mr. Jean Ferret&mdash;if that is the gentleman&rsquo;s
      name. I&rsquo;d join Miss Ward and Cressie Ingle yonder, but Cressie WOULD
      be indignant! I shall soothe my hurt with SWEETEST airs. Adieu.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With that she made me a solemn courtesy and departed, a pretty little
      figure, not little in attractiveness, the strong moonlight, tinged with
      blue, shimmering over her blond hair and splashing brightly among the
      ripples of her silks and laces. She swept across the terrace languidly,
      offering an effect of comedy not unfairylike, and, ascending the steps of
      the veranda, disappeared into the orange candle-light of a salon. A moment
      later some chords were sounded firmly upon a piano in that room, and a
      bitter song swam out to me over the laughter and talk of the people at the
      other tables. It was to be observed that Miss Anne Elliott sang very well,
      though I thought she over-emphasised one line of the stanza:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This world is a world of lies!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps she had poisoned another little arrow for me, too. Impelled by the
      fine night, the groups upon the terrace were tending toward a wider
      dispersal, drifting over the sloping lawns by threes and couples, and I
      was able to identify two figures threading the paths of the garden,
      together, some distance below. Judging by the pace they kept, I should
      have concluded that Miss Ward and Mr. Cresson Ingle sought the healthful
      effects of exercise. However, I could see no good reason for wishing their
      conversation less obviously absorbing, though Miss Elliott&rsquo;s
      insinuation that Mr. Ingle might deplore intrusion upon the interview had
      struck me as too definite to be altogether pleasing. Still, such matters
      could not discontent me with my solitude. Eastward, over the moonlit roof
      of the forest, I could see the quiet ocean, its unending lines of foam
      moving slowly to the long beaches, too far away to be heard. The
      reproachful voice of the singer came no more from the house, but the piano
      ran on into &ldquo;La Vie de Boheme,&rdquo; and out of that into something
      else, I did not know what, but it seemed to be music; at least it was
      musical enough to bring before me some memory of the faces of pretty girls
      I had danced with long ago in my dancing days, so that, what with the
      music, and the distant sea, and the soft air, so sparklingly full of
      moonshine, and the little dancing memories, I was floated off into a
      reverie that was like a prelude for the person who broke it. She came so
      quietly that I did not hear her until she was almost beside me and spoke
      to me. It was the second time that had happened.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Harman,&rdquo; I said, as she took the chair vacated by the
      elfin young lady, &ldquo;you see I can manage it! But perhaps I control
      myself better when there&rsquo;s no camp-stool to inspire me. You remember
      my woodland didoes&mdash;I fear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled in a pleasant, comprehending way, but neither directly replied
      nor made any return speech whatever; instead, she let her forearms rest on
      the broad railing of the marble balustrade, and, leaning forward, gazed
      out over the shining and mysterious slopes below. Somehow it seemed to me
      that her not answering, and her quiet action, as well as the thoughtful
      attitude in which it culminated, would have been thought &ldquo;very like
      her&rdquo; by any one who knew her well. &ldquo;Cousin Louise has her
      ways,&rdquo; Miss Elizabeth had told me; this was probably one of them,
      and I found it singularly attractive. For that matter, from the day of my
      first sight of her in the woods I had needed no prophet to tell me I
      should like Mrs. Harman&rsquo;s ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After the quiet you have had here, all this must seem,&rdquo; I
      said, looking down upon the strollers, &ldquo;a usurpation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they!&rdquo; She disposed of Quesnay&rsquo;s guests with a
      slight movement of her left hand. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an old friend of my
      cousins&mdash;of both of them; but even without that, I know you
      understand. Elizabeth does it all for her brother, of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she likes it,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mr. Ward likes it, too,&rdquo; she added slowly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
      see, when he comes home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Night&rsquo;s effect upon me being always to make me venturesome, I took a
      chance, and ventured perhaps too far. &ldquo;I hope we&rsquo;ll see many
      happy things when he comes home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s her doing things of this sort,&rdquo; she said, giving
      no sign of having heard my remark, &ldquo;that has helped so much to make
      him the success that he is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what has been death to his art!&rdquo; I exclaimed, too
      quickly&mdash;and would have been glad to recall the speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      She met it with a murmur of low laughter that sounded pitying. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t
      it always a dubious relation&mdash;between him and art?&rdquo; And without
      awaiting an answer, she went on, &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s all the better that
      he can have his success!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To this I had nothing whatever to say. So far as I remembered, I had never
      before heard a woman put so much comprehension of a large subject into so
      few words, but in my capacity as George&rsquo;s friend, hopeful for his
      happiness, it made me a little uneasy. During the ensuing pause this
      feeling, at first uppermost, gave way to another not at all in sequence,
      but irresponsible and intuitive, that she had something in particular to
      say to me, had joined me for that purpose, and was awaiting the
      opportunity. As I have made open confession, my curiosity never needed the
      spur; and there is no denying that this impression set it off on the
      gallop; but evidently the moment had not come for her to speak. She seemed
      content to gaze out over the valley in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Cresson Ingle,&rdquo; I hazarded; &ldquo;is he an old, new
      friend of your cousins? I think he was not above the horizon when I went
      to Capri, two years ago?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wants Elizabeth,&rdquo; she returned, adding quietly, &ldquo;as
      you&rsquo;ve seen.&rdquo; And when I had verified this assumption with a
      monosyllable, she continued, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an &lsquo;available,&rsquo;
      but I should hate to have it happen. He&rsquo;s hard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t seem very hard toward her,&rdquo; I murmured,
      looking down into the garden where Mr. Ingle just then happened to be
      adjusting a scarf about his hostess&rsquo;s shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s led a detestable life,&rdquo; said Mrs. Harman, &ldquo;among
      detestable people!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke with sudden, remarkable vigour, and as if she knew. The
      full-throated emphasis she put upon &ldquo;detestable&rdquo; gave the word
      the sting of a flagellation; it rang with a rightful indignation that
      brought vividly to my mind the thought of those three years in Mrs. Harman&rsquo;s
      life which Elizabeth said &ldquo;hurt one to think of.&rdquo; For this was
      the lady who had rejected good George Ward to run away with a man much
      deeper in all that was detestable than Mr. Cresson Ingle could ever be!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems to me much of a type with these others,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they keep their surfaces about the same.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It made me wish <i>I</i> had a little more surface to-night,&rdquo;
      I laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have fitted better. Miss Ward is different at
      different times. When we are alone together she always has the air of
      excusing, or at least explaining, these people to me, but this evening I&rsquo;ve
      had the disquieting thought that perhaps she also explained me to them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; said Mrs. Harman, turning to me quickly. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t
      you see? She was making up to Mr. Ingle for this morning. It came out that
      she&rsquo;d ridden over at daylight to see you; Anne Elliott discovered it
      in some way and told him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This presented an aspect of things so overwhelmingly novel that out of a
      confusion of ideas I was able to fasten on only one with which to continue
      the conversation, and I said irrelevantly that Miss Elliott was a
      remarkable young woman. At this my companion, who had renewed her
      observation of the valley, gave me a full, clear look of earnest scrutiny,
      which set me on the alert, for I thought that now what she desired to say
      was coming. But I was disappointed, for she spoke lightly, with a ripple
      of amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose she finished her investigations? You told her all you
      could?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Almost.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you wouldn&rsquo;t trust ME with the reservation?&rdquo;
      she asked, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would trust you with anything,&rdquo; I answered seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t gratify that child?&rdquo; she said, half
      laughing. Then, to my surprise, her tone changed suddenly, and she began
      again in a hurried low voice: &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t tell her&mdash;&rdquo;
      and stopped there, breathless and troubled, letting me see that I had been
      right after all: this was what she wanted to talk about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell her that young Saffren is mad, no; if that is
      what you mean.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said slowly, sinking
      back in her chair so that her face was in the shadow of the awning which
      sheltered the little table between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, I wouldn&rsquo;t have told her even if it were
      true,&rdquo; I returned, &ldquo;and in the second, it isn&rsquo;t true&mdash;though
      YOU have some reason to think it is,&rdquo; I added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i>?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His speaking to you as he did; a thing on the face of it
      inexcusable&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did he call me &lsquo;Madame d&rsquo;Armand&rsquo;?&rdquo; she
      interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I explained something of the mental processes of Amedee, and she listened
      till I had finished; then bade me continue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; I said blankly, but, with a second
      thought, caught her meaning. &ldquo;Oh, about young Saffren, you mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know him pretty well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;without really
      knowing anything about him; but what is stranger, I believe he doesn&rsquo;t
      really know a great deal about himself. Of course I have a theory about
      him, though it&rsquo;s vague. My idea is that probably through some great
      illness he lost&mdash;not his faculty of memory, but his memories, or, at
      least, most of them. In regard to what he does remember, Professor Keredec
      has anxiously impressed upon him some very poignant necessity for
      reticence. What the necessity may be, or the nature of the professor&rsquo;s
      anxieties, I do not know, but I think Keredec&rsquo;s reasons must be good
      ones. That&rsquo;s all, except that there&rsquo;s something about the
      young man that draws one to him: I couldn&rsquo;t tell you how much I like
      him, nor how sorry I am that he offended you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t offend me,&rdquo; she murmured&mdash;almost
      whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t mean to,&rdquo; I said warmly. &ldquo;You
      understood that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I understood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad. I&rsquo;d been waiting the chance to try to explain&mdash;to
      ask you to pardon him&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there wasn&rsquo;t any need.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean because you understood&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she interrupted gently, &ldquo;not only that. I mean
      because he has done it himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Asked your pardon?&rdquo; I said, in complete surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s written you?&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I saw him to-day,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;This afternoon
      when I went for my walk, he was waiting where the paths intersect&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Some hasty ejaculation, I do not know what, came from me, but she lifted
      her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;As soon as he saw me he came
      straight toward me&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but this won&rsquo;t do at all,&rdquo; I broke out. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      too bad&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait.&rdquo; She leaned forward slightly, lifting her hand again.
      &ldquo;He called me &lsquo;Madame d&rsquo;Armand,&rsquo; and said he must
      know if he had offended me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told him&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him &lsquo;No!&rsquo;&rdquo; And it seemed to me that her
      voice, which up to this point had been low but very steady, shook upon the
      monosyllable. &ldquo;He walked with me a little way&mdash;perhaps It was
      longer&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust me that it sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t happen again!&rdquo; I
      exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see that Keredec knows of this at once. He
      will&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she interrupted quickly, &ldquo;that is just what I
      want you not to do. Will you promise me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll promise anything you ask me. But didn&rsquo;t he
      frighten you? Didn&rsquo;t he talk wildly? Didn&rsquo;t he&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t frighten me&mdash;not as you mean. He was very
      quiet and&mdash;&rdquo; She broke off unexpectedly, with a little pitying
      cry, and turned to me, lifting both hands appealingly&mdash;&ldquo;And oh,
      doesn&rsquo;t he make one SORRY for him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That was just it. She had gone straight to the heart of his mystery: his
      strangeness was the strange PATHOS that invested him; the &ldquo;singularity&rdquo;
      of &ldquo;that other monsieur&rdquo; was solved for me at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had spoken she rose, advanced a step, and stood looking out over
      the valley again, her skirts pressing the balustrade. One of the moments
      in my life when I have wished to be a figure painter came then, as she
      raised her arms, the sleeves, of some filmy texture, falling back from
      them with the gesture, and clasped her hands lightly behind her neck, the
      graceful angle of her chin uplifted to the full rain of moonshine. Little
      Miss Elliott, in the glamour of these same blue showerings, had borrowed
      gauzy weavings of the fay and the sprite, but Mrs. Harman&mdash;tall,
      straight, delicate to fragility, yet not to thinness&mdash;was
      transfigured with a deeper meaning, wearing the sadder, richer colours of
      the tragedy that her cruel young romance had put upon her. She might have
      posed as she stood against the marble railing&mdash;and especially in that
      gesture of lifting her arms&mdash;for a bearer of the gift at some
      foredestined luckless ceremony of votive offerings. So it seemed, at
      least, to the eyes of a moon-dazed old painter-man.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood in profile to me; there were some jasmine flowers at her breast;
      I could see them rise and fall with more than deep breathing; and I
      wondered what the man who had talked of her so wildly, only yesterday,
      would feel if he could know that already the thought of him had moved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t HAD my life. It&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; It was almost
      as if I heard his voice, close at hand, with all the passion of regret and
      protest that rang in the words when they broke from him in the forest. And
      by some miraculous conjecture, within the moment I seemed not only to hear
      his voice but actually to see him, a figure dressed in white, far below us
      and small with the distance, standing out in the moonlight in the middle
      of the tree-bordered avenue leading to the chateau gates.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rose and leaned over the railing. There was no doubt about the reality
      of the figure in white, though it was too far away to be identified with
      certainty; and as I rubbed my eyes for clearer sight, it turned and
      disappeared into the shadows of the orderly grove where I had stood, one
      day, to watch Louise Harman ascend the slopes of Quesnay. But I told
      myself, sensibly, that more than one man on the coast of Normandy might be
      wearing white flannels that evening, and, turning to my companion, found
      that she had moved some steps away from me and was gazing eastward to the
      sea. I concluded that she had not seen the figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a request to make of you,&rdquo; she said, as I turned.
      &ldquo;Will you do it for me&mdash;setting it down just as a whim, if you
      like, and letting it go at that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will,&rdquo; I answered promptly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do
      anything you ask.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She stepped closer, looked at me intently for a second, bit her lip in
      indecision, then said, all in a breath:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell Mr. Saffren my name!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I hadn&rsquo;t meant to,&rdquo; I protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of me to him at all,&rdquo; she said, with the
      same hurried eagerness. &ldquo;Will you let me have my way?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could there be any question of that?&rdquo; I replied, and to my
      astonishment found that we had somehow impulsively taken each other&rsquo;s
      hands, as upon a serious bargain struck between us.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The round moon was white and at its smallest, high overhead, when I
      stepped out of the phaeton in which Miss Elizabeth sent me back to Madame
      Brossard&rsquo;s; midnight was twanging from a rusty old clock indoors as
      I crossed the fragrant courtyard to my pavilion; but a lamp still burned
      in the salon of the &ldquo;Grande Suite,&rdquo; a light to my mind more
      suggestive of the patient watcher than of the scholar at his tome.
    </p>
    <p>
      When my own lamp was extinguished, I set my door ajar, moved my bed out
      from the wall to catch whatever breeze might stir, &ldquo;composed myself
      for the night,&rdquo; as it used to be written, and lay looking out upon
      the quiet garden where a thin white haze was rising. If, in taking this
      coign of vantage, I had any subtler purpose than to seek a draught against
      the warmth of the night, it did not fail of its reward, for just as I had
      begun to drowse, the gallery steps creaked as if beneath some immoderate
      weight, and the noble form of Keredec emerged upon my field of vision.
      From the absence of the sound of footsteps I supposed him to be either
      barefooted or in his stockings. His visible costume consisted of a
      sleeping jacket tucked into a pair of trousers, while his tousled hair and
      beard and generally tossed and rumpled look were those of a man who had
      been lying down temporarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard him sigh&mdash;like one sighing for sleep&mdash;as he went
      noiselessly across the garden and out through the archway to the road. At
      that I sat straight up in bed to stare&mdash;and well I might, for here
      was a miracle! He had lifted his arms above his head to stretch himself
      comfortably, and he walked upright and at ease, whereas when I had last
      seen him, the night before, he had been able to do little more than crawl,
      bent far over and leaning painfully upon his friend. Never man beheld a
      more astonishing recovery from a bad case of rheumatism!
    </p>
    <p>
      After a long look down the road, he retraced his steps; and the moonlight,
      striking across his great forehead as he came, revealed the furrows
      ploughed there by an anxiety of which I guessed the cause. The creaking of
      the wooden stairs and gallery and the whine of an old door announced that
      he had returned to his vigil.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had, perhaps, a quarter of an hour to consider this performance, when it
      was repeated; now, however, he only glanced out into the road, retreating
      hastily, and I saw that he was smiling, while the speed he maintained in
      returning to his quarters was remarkable for one so newly convalescent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment Saffron came through the archway, ascended the steps in
      turn&mdash;but slowly and carefully, as if fearful of waking his guardian&mdash;and
      I heard his door closing, very gently. Long before his arrival, however, I
      had been certain of his identity with the figure I had seen gazing up at
      the terraces of Quesnay from the borders of the grove. Other questions
      remained to bother me: Why had Keredec not prevented this night-roving,
      and why, since he did permit it, should he conceal his knowledge of it
      from Oliver? And what, oh, what wondrous specific had the mighty man found
      for his disease?
    </p>
    <p>
      Morning failed to clarify these mysteries; it brought, however, something
      rare and rich and strange. I allude to the manner of Amedee&rsquo;s
      approach. The aged gossip-demoniac had to recognise the fact that he could
      not keep out of my way for ever; there was nothing for it but to put as
      good a face as possible upon a bad business, and get it over&mdash;and the
      face he selected was a marvel; not less, and in no hasty sense of the
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared at my door to announce that breakfast waited outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Primarily it displayed an expression of serenity, masterly in its
      assumption that not the least, remotest, dreamiest shadow of danger could
      possibly be conceived, by the most immoderately pessimistic and sinister
      imagination, as even vaguely threatening. And for the rest, you have seen
      a happy young mother teaching first steps to the first-born&mdash;that was
      Amedee. Radiantly tender, aggressively solicitous, diffusing ineffable
      sweetness on the air, wreathed in seraphic smiles, beaming caressingly,
      and aglow with a sacred joy that I should be looking so well, he greeted
      me in a voice of honey and bowed me to my repast with an unconcealed
      fondness at once maternal and reverential.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not attempt to speak. I came out silently, uncannily fascinated, my
      eyes fixed upon him, while he moved gently backward, cooing pleasant words
      about the coffee, but just perceptibly keeping himself out of arm&rsquo;s
      reach until I had taken my seat. When I had done that, he leaned over the
      table and began to set useless things nearer my plate with frankly
      affectionate care. It chanced that in &ldquo;making a long arm&rdquo; to
      reach something I did want, my hand (of which the fingers happened to be
      closed) passed rather impatiently beneath his nose. The madonna expression
      changed instantly to one of horror, he uttered a startled croak, and took
      a surprisingly long skip backward, landing in the screen of honeysuckle
      vines, which, he seemed to imagine, were some new form of hostility
      attacking him treacherously from the rear. They sagged, but did not break
      from their fastenings, and his behaviour, as he lay thus entangled, would
      have contrasted unfavourably in dignity with the actions of a
      panic-stricken hen in a hammock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so conscience DOES make cowards of us all,&rdquo; I said, with
      no hope of being understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recovering some measure of mental equilibrium at the same time that he
      managed to find his feet, he burst into shrill laughter, to which he tried
      in vain to impart a ring of debonair carelessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, I stumble!&rdquo; he cried with hollow merriment. &ldquo;I fall
      about and faint with fatigue! Pah! But it is nothing: truly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fatigue!&rdquo; I turned a bitter sneer upon him. &ldquo;Fatigue!
      And you just out of bed!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His fat hands went up palm outward; his heroic laughter was checked as
      with a sob; an expression of tragic incredulity shone from his eyes.
      Patently he doubted the evidence of his own ears; could not believe that
      such black ingratitude existed in the world. &ldquo;Absalom, O my son
      Absalom!&rdquo; was his unuttered cry. His hands fell to his sides; his
      chin sank wretchedly into its own folds; his shirt-bosom heaved and
      crinkled; arrows of unspeakable injustice had entered the defenceless
      breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just out of bed!&rdquo; he repeated, with a pathos that would have
      brought the judge of any court in France down from the bench to kiss him&mdash;&ldquo;And
      I had risen long, long before the dawn, in the cold and darkness of the
      night, to prepare the sandwiches of monsieur!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was too much for me, or rather, he was. I stalked off to the woods in a
      state of helpless indignation; mentally swearing that his day of
      punishment at my hands was only deferred, not abandoned, yet secretly
      fearing that this very oath might live for no purpose but to convict me of
      perjury. His talents were lost in the country; he should have sought his
      fortune in the metropolis. And his manner, as he summoned me that evening
      to dinner, and indeed throughout the courses, partook of the subtle
      condescension and careless assurance of one who has but faintly enjoyed
      some too easy triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found this so irksome that I might have been goaded into an outbreak of
      impotent fury, had my attention not been distracted by the curious turn of
      the professor&rsquo;s malady, which had renewed its painful assault upon
      him. He came hobbling to table, leaning upon Saffren&rsquo;s shoulder, and
      made no reference to his singular improvement of the night before&mdash;nor
      did I. His rheumatism was his own; he might do what he pleased with it!
      There was no reason why he should confide the cause of its vagaries to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Table-talk ran its normal course; a great Pole&rsquo;s philosophy
      receiving flagellation at the hands of our incorrigible optimist. (&ldquo;If
      he could understand,&rdquo; exclaimed Keredec, &ldquo;that the individual
      must be immortal before it is born, ha! then this babbler might have
      writted some intelligence!&rdquo;) On the surface everything was as usual
      with our trio, with nothing to show any turbulence of under-currents,
      unless it was a certain alertness in Oliver&rsquo;s manner, a restrained
      excitement, and the questioning restlessness of his eyes as they sought
      mine from time to time. Whatever he wished to ask me, he was given no
      opportunity, for the professor carried him off to work when our coffee was
      finished. As they departed, the young man glanced back at me over his
      shoulder, with that same earnest look of interrogation, but it went
      unanswered by any token or gesture: for though I guessed that he wished to
      know if Mrs. Harman had spoken of him to me, it seemed part of my bargain
      with her to give him no sign that I understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      A note lay beside my plate next morning, addressed in a writing strange to
      me, one of dashing and vigorous character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the pursuit of thrillingly scientific research,&rdquo; it read,
      &ldquo;what with the tumult which possessed me, I forgot to mention the
      bond that links us; I, too, am a painter, though as yet unhonoured and
      unhung. It must be only because I lack a gentle hand to guide me. If I
      might sit beside you as you paint! The hours pass on leaden wings at
      Quesnay&mdash;I could shriek! Do not refuse me a few words of instruction,
      either in the wildwood, whither I could support your shrinking steps, or,
      from time to time, as you work in your studio, which (I glean from the
      instructive Mr. Ferret) is at Les Trois Pigeons. At any hour, at any
      moment, I will speed to you. I am, sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours, if you will but breathe a &lsquo;yes,&rsquo;
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;ANNE ELLIOTT.&rdquo;
    </h3>
    <p>
      To this I returned a reply, as much in her own key as I could write it,
      putting my refusal on the ground that I was not at present painting in the
      studio. I added that I hoped her suit might prosper, regretting that I
      could not be of greater assistance to that end, and concluded with the
      suggestion that Madame Brossard might entertain an offer for lessons in
      cooking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of my attempt to echo her vivacity was discomfiting, and I was
      allowed to perceive that epistolary jocularity was not thought to be my
      line. It was Miss Elizabeth who gave me this instruction three days later,
      on the way to Quesnay for &ldquo;second breakfast.&rdquo; Exercising
      fairly shame-faced diplomacy, I had avoided dining at the chateau again,
      but, by arrangement, she had driven over for me this morning in the
      phaeton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you writing silly notes to that child?&rdquo; she demanded,
      as soon as we were away from the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it silly?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should know. Do you think that style of humour suitable for a
      young girl?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This bewildered me a little. &ldquo;But there wasn&rsquo;t anything
      offensive&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&rdquo; Miss Elizabeth lifted her eyebrows to a height of bland
      inquiry. &ldquo;She mightn&rsquo;t think it rather&mdash;well, rough? Your
      suggesting that she should take cooking lessons?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But SHE suggested she might take PAINTING lessons,&rdquo; was my
      feeble protest. &ldquo;I only meant to show her I understood that she
      wanted to get to the inn.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why should she care to &lsquo;get to the inn&rsquo;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She seemed interested in a young man who is staying there.
      'Interested&rsquo; is the mildest word for it I can think of.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; Such was Miss Ward&rsquo;s enigmatic retort, and
      though I begged an explanation I got none. Instead, she quickened the
      horse&rsquo;s gait and changed the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the chateau, having a mind to offer some sort of apology, I looked
      anxiously about for the subject of our rather disquieting conversation,
      but she was not to be seen until the party assembled at the table, set
      under an awning on the terrace. Then, to my disappointment, I found no
      opportunity to speak to her, for her seat was so placed as to make it
      impossible, and she escaped into the house immediately upon the conclusion
      of the repast, hurrying away too pointedly for any attempt to detain her&mdash;though,
      as she passed, she sent me one glance of meek reproach which she was at
      pains to make elaborately distinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again taking me for her neighbour at the table, Miss Elizabeth talked to
      me at intervals, apparently having nothing, just then, to make up to Mr.
      Cresson Ingle, but not long after we rose she accompanied him upon some
      excursion of an indefinite nature, which led her from my sight. Thus, the
      others making off to cards indoors and what not, I was left to the perusal
      of the eighteenth century facade of the chateau, one of the most competent
      restorations in that part of France, and of the liveliest interest to the
      student or practitioner of architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Harman had not appeared at all, having gone to call upon some one at
      Dives, I was told, and a servant informing me (on inquiry) that Miss
      Elliott had retired to her room, I was thrust upon my own devices indeed,
      a condition already closely associated in my mind with this picturesque
      spot. The likeliest of my devices&mdash;or, at least, the one I hit upon&mdash;was
      in the nature of an unostentatious retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went home.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, as the day was spoiled for work, I chose a roundabout way, in
      fact the longest, and took the high-road to Dives, but neither the road
      nor the town itself (when I passed through it) rewarded my vague hope that
      I might meet Mrs. Harman, and I strode the long miles in considerable
      disgruntlement, for it was largely in that hope that I had gone to
      Quesnay. It put me in no merrier mood to find Miss Elizabeth&rsquo;s
      phaeton standing outside the inn in charge of a groom, for my vanity
      encouraged the supposition that she had come out of a fear that my
      unceremonious departure from Quesnay might have indicated that I was
      &ldquo;hurt,&rdquo; or considered myself neglected; and I dreaded having
      to make explanations.
    </p>
    <p>
      My apprehensions were unfounded; it was not Miss Elizabeth who had come in
      the phaeton, though a lady from Quesnay did prove to be the occupant&mdash;the
      sole occupant&mdash;of the courtyard. At sight of her I halted stock-still
      under the archway.
    </p>
    <p>
      There she sat, a sketch-book on a green table beside her and a board in
      her lap, brazenly painting&mdash;and a more blushless piece of assurance
      than Miss Anne Elliott thus engaged these eyes have never beheld.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not so hardened that she did not affect a little timidity at sight
      of me, looking away even more quickly than she looked up, while I walked
      slowly over to her and took the garden chair beside her. That gave me a
      view of her sketch, which was a violent little &ldquo;lay-in&rdquo; of
      shrubbery, trees, and the sky-line of the inn. To my prodigious surprise
      (and, naturally enough, with a degree of pleasure) I perceived that it was
      not very bad, not bad at all, indeed. It displayed a sense of values, of
      placing, and even, in a young and frantic way, of colour. Here was a young
      woman of more than &ldquo;accomplishments!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she said, squeezing one of the tiny tubes almost
      dry, and continuing to paint with a fine effect of absorption, &ldquo;I
      HAD to show you that I was in the most ABYSMAL earnest. Will you take me
      painting with, you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I appreciate your seriousness,&rdquo; I rejoined. &ldquo;Has it
      been rewarded?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I say? You haven&rsquo;t told me whether or no I may follow
      you to the wildwood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, have you caught another glimpse of Mr. Saffren?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At that she showed a prettier colour in her cheeks than any in her
      sketch-box, but gave no other sign of shame, nor even of being flustered,
      cheerfully replying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is far from the point. Do you grant my burning plea?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understood I had offended you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;VICIOUSLY!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; I continued. &ldquo;I wanted to ask you to
      forgive me&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I spoke seriously, and that seemed to strike her as odd or needing
      explanation, for she levelled her blue eyes at me, and interrupted, with
      something more like seriousness in her own voice than I had yet heard from
      her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What made you think I was offended?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your look of reproach when you left the table&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing else?&rdquo; she asked quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; Miss Ward told me you were.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; she drove over with you. That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; she exclaimed
      with vigour, and nodded her head as if some suspicion of hers had been
      confirmed. &ldquo;I thought so!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You thought she had told me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Miss Elliott decidedly. &ldquo;Thought that
      Elizabeth wanted to have her cake and eat it too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll get no help from me,&rdquo; she returned slowly,
      a frown marking her pretty forehead. &ldquo;But I was only playing
      offended, and she knew it. I thought your note was THAT fetching!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She continued to look thoughtful for a moment longer, then with a
      resumption of her former manner&mdash;the pretence of an earnestness much
      deeper than the real&mdash;&ldquo;Will you take me painting with you?&rdquo;
      she said. &ldquo;If it will convince you that I mean it, I&rsquo;ll give
      up my hopes of seeing that SUMPTUOUS Mr. Saffren and go back to Quesnay
      now, before he comes home. He&rsquo;s been out for a walk&mdash;a long
      one, since it&rsquo;s lasted ever since early this morning, so the waiter
      told me. May I go with you? You CAN&rsquo;T know how enervating it is up
      there at the chateau&mdash;all except Mrs. Harman, and even she&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about Mrs. Harman?&rdquo; I asked, as she paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think she must be in love.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do think so,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s LIKE it, at
      least.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But with whom?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed gaily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid she&rsquo;s my rival!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not with&mdash;&rdquo; I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, with your beautiful and mad young friend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;oh, it&rsquo;s preposterous!&rdquo; I cried, profoundly
      disturbed. &ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t be! If you knew a great deal about
      her&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may know more than you think. My simplicity of appearance is
      deceptive,&rdquo; she mocked, beginning to set her sketch-box in order.
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t realise that Mrs. Harman and I are quite HURLED
      upon each other at Quesnay, being two ravishingly intelligent women
      entirely surrounded by large bodies of elementals. She has told me a great
      deal of herself since that first evening, and I know&mdash;well, I know
      why she did not come back from Dives this afternoon, for instance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WHY?&rdquo; I fairly shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She slid her sketch into a groove in the box, which she closed, and rose
      to her feet before answering. Then she set her hat a little straighter
      with a touch, looking so fixedly and with such grave interest over my
      shoulder that I turned to follow her glance and encountered our
      reflections in a window of the inn. Her own shed a light upon THAT
      mystery, at all events.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might tell you some day,&rdquo; she said indifferently, &ldquo;if
      I gained enough confidence in you through association in daily pursuits.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear young lady,&rdquo; I cried with real exasperation, &ldquo;I
      am a working man, and this is a working summer for me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;d spoil it?&rdquo; she urged gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I get up with the first daylight to paint,&rdquo; I protested,
      &ldquo;and I paint all day&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved a step nearer me and laid her hand warningly upon my sleeve,
      checking the outburst.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned to see what she meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver Saffren had come in from the road and was crossing to the gallery
      steps. He lifted his hat and gave me a quick word of greeting as he
      passed, and at the sight of his flushed and happy face my riddle was
      solved for me. Amazing as the thing was, I had no doubt of the revelation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; I said to Miss Elliott when he had gone, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t
      have to take pupils to get the answer to my question, now!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, these philosophers,&rdquo; said the professor, expanding in
      discourse a little later&mdash;&ldquo;these dreamy people who talk of the
      spirit, they tell you that spirit is abstract!&rdquo; He waved his great
      hand in a sweeping semicircle which carried it out of our orange
      candle-light and freckled it with the cold moonshine which sieved through
      the loosened screen of honeysuckle. &ldquo;Ha, the folly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do YOU say it is?&rdquo; I asked, moving so that the smoke of
      my cigar should not drift toward Oliver, who sat looking out into the
      garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, my friend? I do not say that it IS! But all such things, they
      are only a question of names, and when I use the word &lsquo;spirit&rsquo;
      I mean identity&mdash;universal identity, if you like. It is what we all
      are, yes&mdash;and those flowers, too. But the spirit of the flowers is
      not what you smell, nor what you see, that look so pretty: it is the
      flowers themself! Yet all spirit is only one spirit and one spirit is all
      spirit&mdash;and if you tell me this is Pant&rsquo;eism I will tell you
      that you do not understand!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t tell you that,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;neither do I
      understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor that big Keredec either!&rdquo; Whereupon he loosed the rolling
      thunder of his laughter. &ldquo;Nor any brain born of the monkey people!
      But this world is full of proof that everything that exist is all one
      thing, and it is the instinct of that, when it draws us together, which
      makes what we call &lsquo;love.&rsquo; Even those wicked devils of egoism
      in our inside is only love which grows too long the wrong way, like the
      finger nails of the Chinese empress. Young love is a little sprout of
      universal unity. When the young people begin to feel it, THEY are not
      abstract, ha? And the young man, when he selects, he chooses one being
      from all the others to mean&mdash;just for him&mdash;all that great
      universe of which he is a part.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was wandering whimsically far afield, but as I caught the
      good-humoured flicker of the professor&rsquo;s glance at our companion I
      thought I saw a purpose in his deviation. Saffren turned toward him
      wonderingly, his unconscious, eager look remarkably emphasised and
      brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All such things are most strange&mdash;great mysteries,&rdquo;
      continued the professor. &ldquo;For when a man has made the selection,
      THAT being DOES become all the universe, and for him there is nothing else
      at all&mdash;nothing else anywhere!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Saffren&rsquo;s cheeks and temples were flushed as they had been when I
      saw him returning that afternoon; and his eyes were wide, fixed upon
      Keredec in a stare of utter amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is true,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Keredec returned his look with an attentive scrutiny, and made some
      exclamation under his breath, which I did not catch, but there was no
      mistaking his high good humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; he shouted, rising and clapping the other upon the
      shoulder. &ldquo;You will soon cure my rheumatism if you ask me questions
      like that! Ho, ho, ho!&rdquo; He threw back his head and let the mighty
      salvos forth. &ldquo;Ho, ho, ho! How do I know? The young, always they
      believe they are the only ones who were ever young! Ho, ho, ho! Come, we
      shall make those lessons very easy to-night. Come, my friend! How could
      that big, old Keredec know of such things? He is too old, too foolish! Ho,
      ho, ho!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he went up the steps, the courtyard reverberating again to his
      laughter, his arm resting on Saffren&rsquo;s shoulders, but not so heavily
      as usual. The door of their salon closed upon them, and for a while
      Keredec&rsquo;s voice could be heard booming cheerfully; it ended in
      another burst of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later Saffren opened the door and called to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; I answered from my veranda, where I had just lighted
      my second cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more work to-night. All finished,&rdquo; he cried jubilantly,
      springing down the steps. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming to have a talk with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Amedee had removed the candles, the moon had withdrawn in fear of a
      turbulent mob of clouds, rioting into our sky from seaward; the air
      smelled of imminent rain, and it was so dark that I could see my visitor
      only as a vague, tall shape; but a happy excitement vibrated in his rich
      voice, and his step on the gravelled path was light and exultant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t sit down,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll walk up
      and down in front of the veranda&mdash;if it doesn&rsquo;t make you
      nervous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For answer I merely laughed; and he laughed too, in genial response,
      continuing gaily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all so different with me! Everything is. That BLIND
      feeling I told you of&mdash;it&rsquo;s all gone. I must have been very
      babyish, the other day; I don&rsquo;t think I could feel like that again.
      It used to seem to me that I lived penned up in a circle of blank stone
      walls; I couldn&rsquo;t see over the top for myself at all, though now and
      then Keredec would boost me up and let me get a little glimmer of the
      country round about&mdash;but never long enough to see what it was really
      like. But it&rsquo;s not so now. Ah!&rdquo;&mdash;he drew a long breath&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d
      like to run. I think I could run all the way to the top of a pretty
      fair-sized mountain to-night, and then&rdquo;&mdash;he laughed&mdash;&ldquo;jump
      off and ride on the clouds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know how that is,&rdquo; I responded. &ldquo;At least I did know&mdash;a
      few years ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything is a jumble with me,&rdquo; he went on happily, in a
      confidential tone, &ldquo;yet it&rsquo;s a heavenly kind of jumble. I can&rsquo;t
      put anything into words. I don&rsquo;t THINK very well yet, though Keredec
      is trying to teach me. My thoughts don&rsquo;t run in order, and this that&rsquo;s
      happened seems to make them wilder, queerer&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped
      short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused in his sentry-go, facing me, and answered, in a low voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen her again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She told me you knew it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;&mdash;that she had
      told you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not all,&rdquo; he said, his voice rising a
      little. &ldquo;I saw her again the day after she told you&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did!&rdquo; I murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I tell myself that it&rsquo;s a dream,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that
      it CAN&rsquo;T be true. For it has been EVERY day since then! That&rsquo;s
      why I haven&rsquo;t joined you in the woods. I have been with her, walking
      with her, listening to her, looking at her&mdash;always feeling that it
      must be unreal and that I must try not to wake up. She has been so kind&mdash;so
      wonderfully, beautifully kind to me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has met you?&rdquo; I asked, thinking ruefully of George Ward,
      now on the high seas in the pleasant company of old hopes renewed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has let me meet her. And to-day we lunched at the inn at Dives
      and then walked by the sea all afternoon. She gave me the whole day&mdash;the
      whole day! You see&rdquo;&mdash;he began to pace again&mdash;&ldquo;you
      see I was right, and you were wrong. She wasn&rsquo;t offended&mdash;she
      was glad&mdash;that I couldn&rsquo;t help speaking to her; she has said
      so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; I interrupted, &ldquo;that she would wish you
      to tell me this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, she likes you!&rdquo; he said so heartily, and appearing
      meanwhile so satisfied with the completeness of his reply, that I was fain
      to take some satisfaction in it myself. &ldquo;What I wanted most to say
      to you,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;is this: you remember you promised to
      tell me whatever you could learn about her&mdash;and about her husband?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s different now. I don&rsquo;t want you to,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;I want only to know what she tells me herself. She has told
      me very little, but I know when the time comes she WILL tell me
      everything. But I wouldn&rsquo;t hasten it. I wouldn&rsquo;t have anything
      changed from just THIS!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean the way it IS. If I could hope to see her every day, to be
      in the woods with her, or down by the shore&mdash;oh, I don&rsquo;t want
      to know anything but that!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt you have told her,&rdquo; I ventured, &ldquo;a good deal
      about yourself,&rdquo; and was instantly ashamed of myself. I suppose I
      spoke out of a sense of protest against Mrs. Harman&rsquo;s strange lack
      of conventionality, against so charming a lady&rsquo;s losing her head as
      completely as she seemed to have lost hers, and it may have been, too, out
      of a feeling of jealousy for poor George&mdash;possibly even out of a
      little feeling of the same sort on my own account. But I couldn&rsquo;t
      have said it except for the darkness, and, as I say, I was instantly
      ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It does not whiten my guilt that the shaft did not reach him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told her all I know,&rdquo; he said readily, and the
      unconscious pathos of the answer smote me. &ldquo;And all that Keredec has
      let me know. You see I haven&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you think,&rdquo; I interrupted quickly, anxious, in my
      remorse, to divert him from that channel, &ldquo;do you think Professor
      Keredec would approve, if he knew?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he would,&rdquo; he responded slowly, pausing in his walk
      again. &ldquo;I have a feeling that perhaps he does know, and yet I have
      been afraid to tell him, afraid he might try to stop me&mdash;keep me from
      going to wait for her. But he has a strange way of knowing things; I think
      he knows everything in the world! I have felt to-night that he knows this,
      and&mdash;it&rsquo;s very strange, but I&mdash;well, what WAS it that made
      him so glad?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The light is still burning in his room,&rdquo; I said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that I ought to tell him?&rdquo; His voice rose a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s done a good deal for you, hasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; I
      suggested. &ldquo;And even if he does know he might like to hear it from
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right; I&rsquo;ll tell him to-night.&rdquo; This came
      with sudden decision, but with less than marked what followed. &ldquo;But
      he can&rsquo;t stop me, now. No one on earth shall do that, except Madame
      d&rsquo;Armand herself. No one!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t quarrel with that,&rdquo; I said drily, throwing away
      my cigar, which had gone out long before.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated, and then I saw his hand groping toward me in the darkness,
      and, rising, I gave him mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; he said, and shook my hand as the first
      sputterings of the coming rain began to patter on the roof of the
      pavilion. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to tell him; I&rsquo;m glad to have told
      you. Ah, but isn&rsquo;t this,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;a happy world!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning, he ran to the gallery steps. &ldquo;At last I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo;
      he called back over his shoulder, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad that I was born&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A gust of wind blew furiously into the courtyard at that instant, and I
      heard his voice indistinctly, but I thought&mdash;though I might have been
      mistaken&mdash;that I caught a final word, and that it was &ldquo;again.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The rain of two nights and two days had freshened the woods, deepening the
      green of the tree-trunks and washing the dust from the leaves, and now,
      under the splendid sun of the third morning, we sat painting in a sylvan
      aisle that was like a hall of Aladdin&rsquo;s palace, the filigreed arches
      of foliage above us glittering with pendulous rain-drops. But Arabian
      Nights&rsquo; palaces are not to my fancy for painting; the air, rinsed of
      its colour, was too sparklingly clean; the interstices of sky and the
      roughly framed distances I prized, were brought too close. It was one of
      those days when Nature throws herself straight in your face and you are at
      a loss to know whether she has kissed you or slapped you, though you are
      conscious of the tingle;&mdash;a day, in brief, more for laughing than for
      painting, and the truth is that I suited its mood only too well, and
      laughed more than I painted, though I sat with my easel before me and a
      picture ready upon my palette to be painted.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one could have understood better than I that this was setting a bad
      example to the acolyte who sat, likewise facing an easel, ten paces to my
      left; a very sportsmanlike figure of a painter indeed, in her short skirt
      and long coat of woodland brown, the fine brown of dead oak-leaves; a
      &ldquo;devastating&rdquo; selection of colour that!&mdash;being much the
      same shade as her hair&mdash;with brown for her hat too, and the veil
      encircling the small crown thereof, and brown again for the stout, high,
      laced boots which protected her from the wet tangle underfoot. Who could
      have expected so dashing a young person as this to do any real work at
      painting? Yet she did, narrowing her eyes to the finest point of
      concentration, and applying herself to the task in hand with a persistence
      which I found, on that particular morning, far beyond my own powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she leaned back critically, at the imminent risk of capsizing her
      camp-stool, and herself with it, in her absorption, some ill-suppressed
      token of amusement most have caught her ear, for she turned upon me with
      suspicion, and was instantly moved to moralize upon the reluctance I had
      shown to accept her as a companion for my excursions; taking as her theme,
      in contrast, her own present display of ambition; all in all a warm, if
      over-coloured, sketch of the idle master and the industrious apprentice.
      It made me laugh again, upon which she changed the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An indefinable something tells me,&rdquo; she announced coldly,
      &ldquo;that henceforth you needn&rsquo;t be so DRASTICALLY fearful of
      being dragged to the chateau for dinner, nor dejeuner either!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did anything ever tell you that I had cause to fear it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, but too simply. &ldquo;Jean Ferret.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anglicise that ruffian&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; I muttered, mirth
      immediately withering upon me, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll know him better. To
      save time: will you mention anything you can think of that he HASN&rsquo;T
      told you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Elliott cocked her head upon one side to examine the work of art she
      was producing, while a slight smile, playing about her lips, seemed to
      indicate that she was appeased. &ldquo;You and Miss Ward are old and dear
      friends, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she asked absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are!&rdquo; I answered between my teeth. &ldquo;For years I have
      sent her costly jewels&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She interrupted me by breaking outright into a peal of laughter, which
      rang with such childish delight that I retorted by offering several
      malevolent observations upon the babbling of French servants and the order
      of mind attributable to those who listened to them. Her defence was to
      affect inattention and paint busily until some time after I had concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s going to take Cressie Ingle,&rdquo; she said
      dreamily, with the air of one whose thoughts have been far, far away.
      &ldquo;It looks preponderously like it. She&rsquo;s been teetertottering
      these AGES and AGES between you&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between whom?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and Mr. Ingle,&rdquo; she replied, not altering her tone in the
      slightest. &ldquo;But she&rsquo;s all for her brother, of course, and
      though you&rsquo;re his friend, Ingle is a personage in the world they
      court, and among the MULTITUDINOUS things his father left him is an art
      magazine, or one that&rsquo;s long on art or something of that sort&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t know just what&mdash;so altogether it will be a good thing for
      DEAREST Mr. Ward. She likes Cressie, of course, though I think she likes
      you better&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I managed to find my voice and interrupt the thistle-brained creature.
      &ldquo;What put these fantasias into your head?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not Jean Ferret,&rdquo; she responded promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cruel of me to break it to you so coarsely&mdash;I know&mdash;but
      if you are ever going to make up your mind to her building as glaring a
      success of you as she has of her brother, I think you must do it now. She&rsquo;s
      on the point of accepting Mr. Ingle, and what becomes of YOU will depend
      on your conduct in the most immediate future. She won&rsquo;t ask you to
      Quesnay again, so you&rsquo;d better go up there on your own accord.&mdash;And
      on your bended knees, too!&rdquo; she added as an afterthought.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sought for something to say which might have a chance of impressing her&mdash;a
      desperate task on the face of it&mdash;and I mentioned that Miss Ward was
      her hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      One might as well have tried to impress Amedee. She &ldquo;made a little
      mouth&rdquo; and went on dabbling with her brushes. &ldquo;Hostess? Pooh!&rdquo;
      she said cheerfully. &ldquo;My INFANTILE father sent me here to be in her
      charge while he ran home to America. Mr. Ward&rsquo;s to paint my
      portrait, when he comes. Give and take&mdash;it&rsquo;s simple enough, you
      see!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was frankness with a vengeance, and I fell back upon silence,
      whereupon a pause ensued, to my share of which I imparted the deepest
      shadow of disapproval within my power. Unfortunately, she did not look at
      me; my effort passed with no other effect than to make some of my facial
      muscles ache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Portrait of Miss E., by George Ward, H. C.,&rsquo;&rdquo;
      this painfully plain-speaking young lady continued presently. &ldquo;On
      the line at next spring&rsquo;s Salon, then packed up for the dear ones at
      home. I&rsquo;d as soon own an &lsquo;Art Bronze,&rsquo; myself&mdash;or a
      nice, clean porcelain Arab.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt you&rsquo;ve forgotten for the moment,&rdquo; I said,
      &ldquo;that Mr. Ward is my friend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in painting, he isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she returned quickly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I consider his work altogether creditable; it&rsquo;s carefully
      done, conscientious, effective&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that true of the ladies in the hairdressers&rsquo;
      windows?&rdquo; she asked with assumed artlessness. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you
      say a kind word for them, good gentleman, and heaven bless you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t I be asked to Quesnay again?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t seemed FANATICALLY appreciative of
      your opportunities when you have been there; you might have carried her
      off from Cresson Ingle instead of vice versa. But after all, you AREN&rsquo;T&rdquo;&mdash;here
      she paused and looked at me appraisingly for a moment-&ldquo;you AREN&rsquo;T
      the most piratical dash-in-and-dash-out and
      leave-everything-upside-down-behind-you sort of man, are you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I believe I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, that&rsquo;s only a SMALL half of the reason,&rdquo; Miss
      Elliott went on. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s furious on account of this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These were vague words, and I said so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, THIS,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;my being here; your letting
      me come. Impropriety&mdash;all of that!&rdquo; A sharp whistle issued from
      her lips. &ldquo;Oh! the EXCORIATING things she&rsquo;s said of my
      pursuing you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But doesn&rsquo;t she know that it&rsquo;s only part of your siege
      of Madame Brossard&rsquo;s; that it&rsquo;s a subterfuge in the hope of
      catching a glimpse of Oliver Saffren?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she cried, her eyes dancing; &ldquo;I told her that, but
      she thinks it&rsquo;s only a subterfuge in the hope of catching more than
      a glimpse of you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I joined laughter with her then. She was the first to stop, and, looking
      at me somewhat doubtfully, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whereas, the truth is that it&rsquo;s neither. You know very well
      that I want to paint.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; I agreed at once. &ldquo;Your devotion to &lsquo;your
      art&rsquo; and your hope of spending half an hour at Madame Brossard&rsquo;s
      now and then are separable;&mdash;which reminds me: Wouldn&rsquo;t you
      like me to look at your sketch?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not yet.&rdquo; She jumped up and brought her camp-stool over
      to mine. &ldquo;I feel that I could better bear what you&rsquo;ll say of
      it after I&rsquo;ve had some lunch. Not a SYLLABLE of food has crossed my
      lips since coffee at dawn!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I spread before her what Amedee had prepared; not sandwiches for the
      pocket to-day, but a wicker hamper, one end of which we let rest upon her
      knees, the other upon mine, and at sight of the foie gras, the delicate,
      devilled partridge, the truffled salad, the fine yellow cheese, and the
      long bottle of good red Beaune, revealed when the cover was off, I could
      almost have forgiven the old rascal for his scandal-mongering. As for my
      vis-a-vis, she pronounced it a &ldquo;maddening sight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fall to, my merry man,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;and eat your fill
      of this fair pasty, under the greenwood tree.&rdquo; Obeying her
      instructions with right good-will, and the lady likewise evincing no
      hatred of the viands, we made a cheerful meal of it, topping it with
      peaches and bunches of grapes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is unfair to let you do all the catering,&rdquo; said Miss
      Elliott, after carefully selecting the largest and best peach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jean Ferret&rsquo;s friend does that,&rdquo; I returned, watching
      her rather intently as she dexterously peeled the peach. She did it very
      daintily, I had to admit that&mdash;though I regretted to observe
      indications of the gourmet in one so young. But when it was peeled clean,
      she set it on a fresh green leaf, and, to my surprise, gave it to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she continued, not observing my remorseful
      confusion, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t destroy Elizabeth&rsquo;s peace of mind
      and then raid her larder to boot. That poor lady! I make her trouble
      enough, but it&rsquo;s nothing to what she&rsquo;s going to have when she
      finds out some things that she must find out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About Mrs. Harman,&rdquo; was the serious reply. &ldquo;Elizabeth
      hasn&rsquo;t a clue.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Clue&rsquo;?&rdquo; I echoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Louise&rsquo;s strange affair.&rdquo; Miss Elliott&rsquo;s
      expression had grown as serious as her tone. &ldquo;It is strange; the
      strangest thing I ever knew.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s your own case,&rdquo; I urged. &ldquo;Why should
      you think it strange of her to take an interest in Saffren?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I adore him, of course,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He is the most
      glorious-looking person I&rsquo;ve ever seen, but on my WORD&mdash;&rdquo;
      She paused, and as her gaze met mine I saw real earnestness in her eyes.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;I was half joking the other day&mdash;but
      now I&rsquo;m really afraid Louise is beginning to be in love with him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mightn&rsquo;t it be only interest, so far?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s much more. And I&rsquo;ve grown so fond of her!&rdquo;
      the girl went on, her voice unexpectedly verging upon tremulousness.
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s quite wonderful in her way&mdash;such an understanding
      sort of woman, and generous and kind; there are so many things turning up
      in a party like ours at Quesnay that show what people are really made of,
      and she&rsquo;s a rare, fine spirit. It seems a pity, with such a
      miserable first experience as she had, that this should happen. Oh I know,&rdquo;
      she continued rapidly, cutting off a half-formed protest of mine. &ldquo;He
      isn&rsquo;t mad&mdash;and I&rsquo;m sorry I tried to be amusing about it
      the night you dined at the chateau. I know perfectly well he&rsquo;s not
      insane; but I&rsquo;m absolutely sure, from one thing and another, that&mdash;well&mdash;he
      isn&rsquo;t ALL THERE! He&rsquo;s as beautiful as a seraph and probably as
      good as one, but something is MISSING about him&mdash;and it begins to
      look like a second tragedy for her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean, she really&mdash;&rdquo; I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; she returned, with a catch in her throat. &ldquo;She
      conies to my room when the others are asleep. Not that she tells me a
      great deal, but it&rsquo;s in the air, somehow; she told me with such a
      strained sort of gaiety of their meeting and his first joining her; and
      there was something underneath as if she thought <i>I</i> might be really
      serious in my ravings about him, and&mdash;yes, as if she meant to warn me
      off. And the other night, when I saw her after their lunching together at
      Dives, I asked her teasingly if she&rsquo;d had a happy day, and she
      laughed the prettiest laugh I ever heard and put her arms around me&mdash;then
      suddenly broke out crying and ran out of the room.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that may have been no more than over-strained nerves,&rdquo; I
      feebly suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it was!&rdquo; she cried, regarding me with justifiable
      astonishment. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the CAUSE of their being overstrained that
      interests me! It&rsquo;s all so strange and distressing,&rdquo; she
      continued more gently, &ldquo;that I wish I weren&rsquo;t there to see it.
      And there&rsquo;s poor George Ward coming&mdash;ah! and when Elizabeth
      learns of it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Harman had her way once, in spite of everything,&rdquo; I said
      thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she was a headstrong girl of nineteen, then. But let&rsquo;s
      not think it could go as far as that! There!&rdquo; She threw a
      peach-stone over her shoulder and sprang up gaily. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not
      talk of it; I THINK of it enough! It&rsquo;s time for you to give me a
      RACKING criticism on my morning&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking off her coat as she spoke, she unbuttoned the cuffs of her manly
      blouse and rolled up her sleeves as far as they would go, preparations
      which I observed with some perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you intend any violence,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;in case my views
      of your work shouldn&rsquo;t meet your own, I think I&rsquo;ll be leaving.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; she responded, and kneeling upon one knee beside a
      bush near by, thrust her arms elbow-deep under the outer mantle of leaves,
      shaking the stems vigorously, and sending down a shower of sparkling
      drops. Never lived sane man, or madman, since time began, who, seeing her
      then, could or would have denied that she made the very prettiest picture
      ever seen by any person or persons whatsoever&mdash;but her purpose was
      difficult to fathom. Pursuing it, I remarked that it was improbable that
      birds would be nesting so low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for a finger bowl,&rdquo; she said briskly. And rising,
      this most practical of her sex dried her hands upon a fresh serviette from
      the hamper. &ldquo;Last night&rsquo;s rain is worth two birds in the bush.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With that, she readjusted her sleeves, lightly donned her coat, and
      preceded me to her easel. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she commanded, &ldquo;slaughter!
      It&rsquo;s what I let you come with me for.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at her sketch with much more attention than I had given the small
      board she had used as a bait in the courtyard of Les Trois Pigeons. Today
      she showed a larger ambition, and a larger canvas as well&mdash;or,
      perhaps I should say a larger burlap, for she had chosen to paint upon
      something strongly resembling a square of coffee-sacking. But there was no
      doubt she had &ldquo;found colour&rdquo; in a swash-buckling, bullying
      style of forcing it to be there, whether it was or not, and to &ldquo;vibrate,&rdquo;
      whether it did or not. There was not much to be said, for the violent kind
      of thing she had done always hushes me; and even when it is well done I am
      never sure whether its right place is the &ldquo;Salon des Independants&rdquo;
      or the Luxembourg. It SEEMS dreadful, and yet sometimes I fear in secret
      that it may be a real transition, or even an awakening, and that the men I
      began with, and I, are standing still. The older men called US lunatics
      once, and the critics said we were &ldquo;daring,&rdquo; but that was long
      ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had to speak, so I paraphrased a mot of Degas (I think it was Degas) and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Rousseau could come to life and see this sketch of yours, I
      imagine he would be very much interested, but if he saw mine he might say,
      'That is my fault!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;OH!&rdquo; she cried, her colour rising quickly; she looked
      troubled for a second, then her eyes twinkled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not
      going to let my work make a difference between us, are you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll even try to look at it from your own point of view,&rdquo;
      I answered, stepping back several yards to see it better, though I should
      have had to retire about a quarter of the length of a city block to see it
      quite from her own point of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved with me, both of us walking backward. I began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a day like this, with all the colour in the trees themselves
      and so very little in the air&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There came an interruption, a voice of unpleasant and wiry nasality,
      speaking from behind us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WELL, WELL!&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;So here we are again!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I faced about and beheld, just emerged from a by-path, a fox-faced young
      man whose light, well-poised figure was jauntily clad in gray serge, with
      scarlet waistcoat and tie, white shoes upon his feet, and a white hat,
      gaily beribboned, upon his head. A recollection of the dusky road and a
      group of people about Pere Baudry&rsquo;s lamplit door flickered across my
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The historical tourist!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;The highly
      pedestrian tripper from Trouville!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got me right, m&rsquo;dear friend,&rdquo; he replied with
      condescension; &ldquo;I rec&rsquo;leck meetin&rsquo; you perfect.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I was interested to learn,&rdquo; said I, carefully observing
      the effect of my words upon him, &ldquo;that you had been to Les Trois
      Pigeons after all. Perhaps I might put it, you had been through Les Trois
      Pigeons, for the maitre d&rsquo;hotel informed me you had investigated
      every corner&mdash;that wasn&rsquo;t locked.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; he returned, with rather less embarrassment than a
      brazen Vishnu would have exhibited under the same circumstances. &ldquo;He
      showed me what pitchers they was in your studio. I&rsquo;ll luk &lsquo;em
      over again fer ye one of these days. Some of &lsquo;em was right gud.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be visiting near enough for me to avail myself of the
      opportunity?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right in the Pigeon House, m&rsquo;friend. I&rsquo;ve just come
      down t&rsquo;putt in a few days there,&rdquo; he responded coolly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;s
      a young feller in this neighbourhood I take a kind o&rsquo; fam&rsquo;ly
      interest in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; I asked quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      For answer he produced the effect of a laugh by widening and lifting one
      side of his mouth, leaving the other, meantime, rigid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo; lemme int&rsquo;rup&rsquo; the conv&rsquo;sation with
      yer lady-friend,&rdquo; he said winningly. &ldquo;What they call &lsquo;talkin&rsquo;
      High Arts,&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;d like to hear some.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Miss Elliott&rsquo;s expression, when I turned to observe the effect of
      the intruder upon her, was found to be one of brilliant delight. With
      glowing eyes, her lips parted in a breathless ecstasy, she gazed upon the
      newcomer, evidently fearing to lose a syllable that fell from his lips.
      Moving closer to me she whispered urgently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep him. Oh, keep him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To detain him, for a time at least, was my intention, though my motive was
      not merely to afford her pleasure. The advent of the young man had
      produced a singularly disagreeable impression upon me, quite apart from
      any antagonism I might have felt toward him as a type. Strange suspicions
      leaped into my mind, formless&mdash;in the surprise of the moment&mdash;but
      rapidly groping toward definite outline; and following hard upon them
      crept a tingling apprehension. The reappearance of this rattish youth,
      casual as was the air with which he strove to invest it, began to assume,
      for me, the character of a theatrical entrance of unpleasant portent&mdash;a
      suggestion just now enhanced by an absurdly obvious notion of his own that
      he was enacting a part. This was written all over him, most legibly in his
      attitude of the knowing amateur, as he surveyed Miss Elliott&rsquo;s
      painting patronisingly, his head on one side, his cane in the crook of his
      elbows behind his back, and his body teetering genteelly as he shifted his
      weight from his toes to his heels and back again, nodding meanwhile a
      slight but judicial approbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, about how much,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;would you expec&rsquo;
      t&rsquo; git f&rsquo;r a pitcher that size?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t mine,&rdquo; I informed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t tell me it&rsquo;s the little lady&rsquo;s&mdash;what?&rdquo;
      He bowed genially and favoured Miss Elliott with a stare of warm
      admiration. &ldquo;Pretty a thing as I ever see,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she cried with an ardour that choked her slightly.
      &ldquo;THANK you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I meant the PITCHER!&rdquo; he said hastily, evidently
      nonplussed by a gratitude so fervent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The incorrigible damsel cast down her eyes in modesty. &ldquo;And I had
      hoped,&rdquo; she breathed, &ldquo;something so different!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not be certain whether or not he caught the whisper; I thought he
      did. At all events, the surface of his easy assurance appeared somewhat
      disarranged; and, perhaps to restore it by performing the rites of
      etiquette, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I expec&rsquo; the smart thing now is to pass the cards, but
      mine&rsquo;s in my grip an&rsquo; it ain&rsquo;t unpacked yet. The name
      you&rsquo;d see on &lsquo;em is Oil Poicy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oil Poicy,&rdquo; echoed Miss Elliott, turning to me in genuine
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Earl Percy,&rdquo; I translated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, RAPTUROUS!&rdquo; she cried, her face radiant. &ldquo;And WON&rsquo;T
      Mr. Percy give us his opinion of my Art?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy was in doubt how to take her enthusiasm; he seemed on the point
      of turning surly, and hesitated, while a sharp vertical line appeared on
      his small forehead; but he evidently concluded, after a deep glance at
      her, that if she was making game of him it was in no ill-natured spirit&mdash;nay,
      I think that for a few moments he suspected her liveliness to be some
      method of her own for the incipient stages of a flirtation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally he turned again to the easel, and as he examined the painting
      thereon at closer range, amazement overspread his features. However,
      pulling himself together, he found himself able to reply&mdash;and with
      great gallantry:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, on&rsquo;y t&rsquo; think them little hands cud &lsquo;a&rsquo;
      done all that rough woik!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The unintended viciousness of this retort produced an effect so marked,
      that, except for my growing uneasiness, I might have enjoyed her
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was, I saved her face by entering into the conversation with a
      question, which I put quickly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You intend pursuing your historical researches in the neighborhood?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The facial contortion which served him for a laugh, and at the same time
      as a symbol of unfathomable reserve, was repeated, accompanied by a jocose
      manifestation, in the nature of a sharp and taunting cackle, which seemed
      to indicate a conviction that he was getting much the best of it in some
      conflict of wits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them fairy tales I handed you about ole Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc and
      William the Conker,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;say, they must &lsquo;a&rsquo;
      made you sore after-WOIDS!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I was much interested in everything pertaining to
      your too brief visit,&rdquo; I returned; &ldquo;I am even more so now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, m&rsquo;friend&rdquo;&mdash;he shot me a sidelong,
      distrustful glance&mdash;&ldquo;keep yer eyes open.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is just the point!&rdquo; I laughed, with intentional
      significance, for I meant to make Mr. Percy talk as much as I could. To
      this end, remembering that specimens of his kind are most indiscreet when
      carefully enraged, I added, simulating his own manner:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eyes open&mdash;and doors locked! What?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this I heard a gasp of astonishment from Miss Elliott, who must have
      been puzzled indeed; but I was intent upon the other. He proved perfectly
      capable of being insulted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess they ain&rsquo;t much need o&rsquo; lockin&rsquo; YOUR
      door,&rdquo; he retorted darkly; &ldquo;not from what I saw when I was in
      your studio!&rdquo; He should have stopped there, for the hit was palpable
      and justified; but in his resentment he overdid it. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t
      be scared of anybody&rsquo;s cartin&rsquo; off THEM pitchers, young
      feller! WHOOSH! An&rsquo; f&rsquo;m the luks of the CLO&rsquo;ES I saw
      hangin&rsquo; on the wall,&rdquo; he continued, growing more nettled as I
      smiled cheerfully upon him, &ldquo;I don&rsquo; b&rsquo;lieve you gut any
      worries comin&rsquo; about THEM, neither!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose our tastes are different,&rdquo; I said, letting my smile
      broaden. &ldquo;There might be protection in that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His stare at me was protracted to an unseemly length before the sting of
      this remark reached him; it penetrated finally, however, and in his sharp
      change of posture there was a lightning flicker of the experienced boxer;
      but he checked the impulse, and took up the task of obliterating me in
      another way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I tell the little dame here,&rdquo; he said, pitching his voice
      higher and affecting the plaintive, &ldquo;I make no passes at a friend o&rsquo;
      her&mdash;not in front o&rsquo; her, anyways. But when it comes to these
      here ole, ancient curiosities&rdquo;&mdash;he cackled again, loudly&mdash;&ldquo;well,
      I guess them clo&rsquo;es I see, that day, kin hand it out t&rsquo;
      anything they got in the museums! 'Look here,&rsquo; I says to the waiter,
      &lsquo;THESE must be&rsquo;n left over f&rsquo;m ole Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc
      herself,&rsquo; I says. &lsquo;Talk about yer relics,&rsquo; I says.
      Whoosh! I&rsquo;d like t&rsquo; died!&rdquo; He laughed violently, and
      concluded by turning upon me with a contemptuous flourish of his stick.
      &ldquo;You think I d&rsquo;know what makes YOU so raw?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The form of repartee necessary to augment his ill humour was, of course, a
      matter of simple mechanism for one who had not entirely forgotten his
      student days in the Quarter; and I delivered it airily, though I shivered
      inwardly that Miss Elliott should hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything will be all right if, when you dine at the inn, you&rsquo;ll
      sit with your back toward me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To my shamed surprise, this roustabout wit drew a nervous, silvery giggle
      from her; and that completed the work with Mr. Percy, whose face grew
      scarlet with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a hot one, you are!&rdquo; he sneered, with shocking
      bitterness. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite the teaser, ain&rsquo;t ye, s&rsquo;long&rsquo;s
      yer lady-friend is lukkin&rsquo; on! I guess they&rsquo;ll be a few
      surprises comin&rsquo; YOUR way, before long. P&rsquo;raps I cudn&rsquo;t
      give ye one now &lsquo;f I had a mind to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw,&rdquo; I laughed, and, venturing at hazard, said, &ldquo;I
      know all YOU know!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you do!&rdquo; he cried scornfully. &ldquo;I reckon you might
      set up an&rsquo; take a little notice, though, if you knowed &lsquo;at I
      know all YOU know!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? Maybe you think I don&rsquo;t know what makes you so raw with
      ME? Maybe you think I don&rsquo;t know who ye&rsquo;ve got so thick with
      at this here Pigeon House; maybe you think I don&rsquo;t know who them
      people ARE!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t. You have learned,&rdquo; I said, trying to
      control my excitement, &ldquo;nothing! Whoever hired YOU for a spy lost
      the money. YOU don&rsquo;t know ANY-thing!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I DON&rsquo;T!&rdquo; And with that his voice went to a
      half-shriek. &ldquo;Maybe you think I&rsquo;m down here f&rsquo;r my
      health; maybe you think I come out f&rsquo;r a pleasant walk in the woods
      right now; maybe you think I ain&rsquo;t seen no other lady-friend o&rsquo;
      yours besides this&rsquo;n to-day, and maybe I didn&rsquo;t see who was
      with her&mdash;yes, an&rsquo; maybe you think I d&rsquo;know no other
      times he&rsquo;s be&rsquo;n with her. Maybe you think I ain&rsquo;t be&rsquo;n
      layin&rsquo; low over at Dives! Maybe I don&rsquo;t know a few real NAMES
      in this neighbourhood! Oh, no, MAYBE not!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what the maitre d&rsquo;hotel told you; nothing more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about the name&mdash;OLIVER SAFFREN?&rdquo; he cried fiercely,
      and at last, though I had expected it, I uttered an involuntary
      exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about it?&rdquo; he shouted, advancing toward me triumphantly,
      shaking his forefinger in my face. &ldquo;Hey? THAT stings some, does it?
      Sounds kind o&rsquo; like a FALSE name, does it? Got ye where the hair is
      short, that time, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of names,&rdquo; I retorted, &ldquo;&lsquo;Oil Poicy&rsquo;
      doesn&rsquo;t seem to ring particularly true to me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be gud enough fer you, young feller,&rdquo; he
      responded angrily. &ldquo;It may belong t&rsquo; me, an&rsquo; then again,
      it maybe don&rsquo;t. It ain&rsquo; gunna git me in no trouble; I&rsquo;ll
      luk out f&rsquo;r that. YOUR side&rsquo;s where the trouble is; that&rsquo;s
      what&rsquo;s eatin&rsquo; into you. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll tell you
      flat-foot, your gittin&rsquo; rough &lsquo;ith me and playin&rsquo;
      Charley the Show-Off in front o&rsquo; yer lady-friends&rsquo;ll all go
      down in the bill. These people ye&rsquo;ve got so chummy with&mdash;THEY&rsquo;LL
      pay f&rsquo;r it all right, don&rsquo;t you shed no tears over that!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t by any possibility,&rdquo; I said deliberately,
      with as much satire as I could command, &ldquo;you couldn&rsquo;t possibly
      mean that any sum of mere money might be a salve for the injuries my
      unkind words have inflicted?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more he seemed upon the point of destroying me physically, but, with
      a slight shudder, controlled himself. Stepping close to me, he thrust his
      head forward and measured the emphases of his speech by his right
      forefinger upon my shoulder, as he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You paint THIS in yer pitchers, m&rsquo; dear friend; they&rsquo;s
      jest as much law in this country as they is on the corner o&rsquo;
      Twenty-thoid Street an&rsquo; Fif&rsquo; Avenoo! You keep out the way of
      it, or you&rsquo;ll git runned over!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Delivering a final tap on my shoulder as a last warning, he wheeled deftly
      upon his heel, addressed Miss Elliott briefly, &ldquo;Glad t&rsquo; know
      YOU, lady,&rdquo; and striking into the by-path by which he had approached
      us, was soon lost to sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl faced me excitedly. &ldquo;What IS it?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;It
      seemed to me you insulted him deliberately&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wanted to make him angry?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I thought so!&rdquo; she exclaimed breathlessly. &ldquo;I knew
      there was something serious underneath. It&rsquo;s about Mr. Saffren?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is serious indeed, I fear,&rdquo; I said, and turning to my own
      easel, began to get my traps together. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you the
      little I know, because I want you to tell Mrs. Harman what has just
      happened, and you&rsquo;ll be able to do it better if you understand what
      is understandable about the rest of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean you wouldn&rsquo;t tell me so that I could understand for
      myself?&rdquo; There was a note of genuine grieved reproach in her voice.
      &ldquo;Ah, then I&rsquo;ve made you think me altogether a hare-brain!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t time to tell you what I think of you,&rdquo; I said
      brusquely, and, strangely enough, it seemed to please her. But I paid
      little attention to that, continuing quickly: &ldquo;When Professor
      Keredec and Mr. Saffren came to Les Trois Pigeons, they were so careful to
      keep out of everybody&rsquo;s sight that one might have suspected that
      they were in hiding&mdash;and, in fact, I&rsquo;m sure that they were&mdash;though,
      as time passed and nothing alarming happened, they&rsquo;ve felt reassured
      and allowed themselves more liberty. It struck me that Keredec at first
      dreaded that they might be traced to the inn, and I&rsquo;m afraid his
      fear was justified, for one night, before I came to know them, I met Mr.
      &lsquo;Percy&rsquo; on the road; he&rsquo;d visited Madame Brossard&rsquo;s
      and pumped Amedee dry, but clumsily tried to pretend to me that he had not
      been there at all. At the time, I did not connect him even remotely with
      Professor Keredec&rsquo;s anxieties. I imagined he might have an eye to
      the spoons; but it&rsquo;s as ridiculous to think him a burglar as it
      would be to take him for a detective. What he is, or what he has to do
      with Mr. Saffren, I can guess no more than I can guess the cause of
      Keredec&rsquo;s fears, but the moment I saw him to-day, saw that he&rsquo;d
      come back, I knew it was THAT, and tried to draw him out. You heard what
      he said; there&rsquo;s no doubt that Saffren stands in danger of some
      kind. It may be inconsiderable, or even absurd, but it&rsquo;s evidently
      imminent, and no matter what it is, Mrs. Harman must be kept out of it. I
      want you to see her as soon as you can and ask her from me&mdash;no,
      persuade her yourself&mdash;not to leave Quesnay for a day or two. I mean,
      that she absolutely MUST NOT meet Mr. Saffren again until we know what all
      this means. Will you do it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I will!&rdquo; And she began hastily to get her belongings in
      marching order. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do anything in the world you&rsquo;ll
      let me&mdash;and oh, I hope they can&rsquo;t do anything to poor, poor Mr.
      Saffren!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our sporting friend had evidently seen him with Mrs. Harman to-day,&rdquo;
      I said. &ldquo;Do you know if they went to the beach again?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only know she meant to meet him&mdash;but she told me she&rsquo;d
      be back at the chateau by four. If I start now&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t the phaeton to be sent to the inn for you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not until six,&rdquo; she returned briskly, folding her easel and
      strapping it to her camp-stool with precision. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it
      shorter by the woods?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve only to follow this path to the second crossing and
      then turn to the right,&rdquo; I responded. &ldquo;I shall hurry back to
      Madame Brossard&rsquo;s to see Keredec&mdash;and here&rdquo;&mdash;I
      extended my hand toward her traps, of which, in a neatly practical
      fashion, she had made one close pack&mdash;&ldquo;let me have your things,
      and I&rsquo;ll take care of them at the inn for you. They&rsquo;re heavy,
      and it&rsquo;s a long trudge.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have your own to carry,&rdquo; she answered, swinging the strap
      over her shoulder. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something of a walk for you, too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, let me have them,&rdquo; I protested, for the walk before
      her WAS long and the things would be heavy indeed before it ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go your ways,&rdquo; she laughed, and as my hand still remained
      extended she grasped it with her own and gave it a warm and friendly
      shake. &ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; And with an optimism which took my breath, she
      said, &ldquo;I know YOU can make it come out all right! Besides, I&rsquo;ll
      help you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With that she turned and started manfully upon her journey. I stared after
      her for a moment or more, watching the pretty brown dress flashing in and
      out of shadow among the ragged greeneries, shafts of sunshine now and then
      flashing upon her hair. Then I picked up my own pack and set out for the
      inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one knows that the more serious and urgent the errand a man may be
      upon, the more incongruous are apt to be the thoughts that skip into his
      mind. As I went through the woods that day, breathless with haste and
      curious fears, my brain became suddenly, unaccountably busy with a dream I
      had had, two nights before. I had not recalled this dream on waking: the
      recollection of it came to me now for the first time. It was a usual
      enough dream, wandering and unlifelike, not worth the telling; and I had
      been thinking so constantly of Mrs. Harman that there was nothing
      extraordinary in her worthless ex-husband&rsquo;s being part of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, looking back upon that last, hurried walk of mine through the
      forest, I see how strange it was that I could not quit remembering how in
      my dream I had gone motoring up Mount Pilatus with the man I had seen so
      pitiably demolished on the Versailles road, two years before&mdash;Larrabee
      Harman.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Keredec was alone in his salon, extended at ease upon a long chair, an
      ottoman and a stool, when I burst in upon him; a portentous volume was in
      his lap, and a prolific pipe, smoking up from his great cloud of beard,
      gave the final reality to the likeness he thus presented of a range of
      hills ending in a volcano. But he rolled the book cavalierly to the floor,
      limbered up by sections to receive me, and offered me a hearty welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, my dear sir,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you take pity on the
      lonely Keredec; you make him a visit. I could not wish better for myself.
      We shall have a good smoke and a good talk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are improved to-day?&rdquo; I asked, it may be a little slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Improve?&rdquo; he repeated inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your rheumatism, I mean.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, yes; that rheumatism!&rdquo; he shouted, and throwing back his
      head, rocked the room with sudden laughter. &ldquo;Hew! But it is gone&mdash;almost!
      Oh, I am much better, and soon I shall be able to go in the woods again
      with my boy.&rdquo; He pushed a chair toward me. &ldquo;Come, light your
      cigar; he will not return for an hour perhaps, and there is plenty of time
      for the smoke to blow away. So! It is better. Now we shall talk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I wanted to talk with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a&mdash;what you call?&mdash;ha, yes, a coincidence,&rdquo;
      he returned, stretching himself again in the long chair, &ldquo;a happy
      coincidence; for I have wished a talk with you; but you are away so early
      for all day, and in the evening Oliver, he is always here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think what I wanted to talk about concerns him particularly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; The professor leaned forward, looking at me gravely.
      &ldquo;That is another coincidence. But you shall speak first. Commence
      then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel that you know me at least well enough,&rdquo; I began rather
      hesitatingly, &ldquo;to be sure that I would not, for the world, make any
      effort to intrude in your affairs, or Mr. Saffren&rsquo;s, and that I
      would not force your confidence in the remotest&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; he interrupted. &ldquo;Please do not fear I
      shall misinterpretate whatever you will say. You are our friend. We know
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; I pursued; &ldquo;then I speak with no fear of
      offending. When you first came to the inn I couldn&rsquo;t help seeing
      that you took a great many precautions for secrecy; and when you afterward
      explained these precautions to me on the ground that you feared somebody
      might think Mr. Saffren not quite sane, and that such an impression might
      injure him later&mdash;well, I could not help seeing that your explanation
      did not cover all the ground.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true&mdash;it did not.&rdquo; He ran his huge hand through
      the heavy white waves of his hair, and shook his head vigorously. &ldquo;No;
      I knew it, my dear sir, I knew it well. But, what could I do? I would not
      have telled my own mother! This much I can say to you: we came here at a
      risk, but I thought that with great care it might be made little. And I
      thought a great good thing might be accomplish if we should come here,
      something so fine, so wonderful, that even if the danger had been great I
      would have risked it. I will tell you a little more: I think that great
      thing is BEING accomplish!&rdquo; Here he rose to his feet excitedly and
      began to pace the room as he talked, the ancient floor shaking with his
      tread. &ldquo;I think it is DONE! And ha! my dear sir, if it SHOULD be,
      this big Keredec will not have lived in vain! It was a great task I
      undertake with my young man, and the glory to see it finish is almost
      here. Even if the danger should come, the THING is done, for all that is
      real and has true meaning is inside the soul!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was in connection with the risk you have mentioned that I came
      to talk,&rdquo; I returned with some emphasis, for I was convinced of the
      reality of Mr. Earl Percy and also very certain that he had no existence
      inside or outside a soul. &ldquo;I think it necessary that you should know&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the professor was launched. I might as well have swept the rising tide
      with a broom. He talked with magnificent vehemence for twenty minutes, his
      theme being some theory of his own that the individuality of a soul is
      immortal, and that even in perfection, the soul cannot possibly merge into
      any Nirvana. Meantime, I wondered how Mr. Percy was employing his time,
      but after one or two ineffectual attempts to interrupt, I gave myself to
      silence until the oration should be concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so it is with my boy,&rdquo; he proclaimed, coming at last to
      the case in hand. &ldquo;The spirit of him, the real Oliver Saffren, THAT
      has NEVER change! The outside of him, those thing that BELONG to him, like
      his memory, THEY have change, but not himself, for himself is eternal and
      unchangeable. I have taught him, yes; I have helped him get the small
      things we can add to our possession&mdash;a little knowledge, maybe, a
      little power of judgment. But, my dear sir, I tell you that such things
      are ONLY possessions of a man. They are not the MAN! All that a man IS or
      ever shall be, he is when he is a baby. So with Oliver; he had lived a
      little while, twenty-six years, perhaps, when pft&mdash;like that!&mdash;he
      became almost as a baby again. He could remember how to talk, but not much
      more. He had lost his belongings&mdash;they were gone from the lobe of the
      brain where he had stored them; but HE was not gone, no part of the real
      HIMSELF was lacking. Then presently they send him to me to make new his
      belongings, to restore his possessions. Ha, what a task! To take him with
      nothing in the world of his own and see that he get only GOOD possessions,
      GOOD knowledge, GOOD experience! I took him to the mountains of the Tyrol&mdash;two
      years&mdash;and there his body became strong and splendid while his brain
      was taking in the stores. It was quick, for his brain had retained some
      habits; it was not a baby&rsquo;s brain, and some small part of its old
      stores had not been lost. But if anything useless or bad remain, we empty
      it out&mdash;I and those mountain&rsquo; with their pure air. Now, I say
      he is all good and the work was good; I am proud! But I wish to restore
      ALL that was good in his life; your Keredec is something of a poet.&mdash;You
      may put it: much the old fool! And for that greates&rsquo; restoration of
      all I have brought my boy back to France; since it was necessary. It was a
      madness, and I thank the good God I was mad enough to do it. I cannot tell
      you yet, my dear sir: but you shall see, you shall see what the folly of
      that old Keredec has done! You shall see, you shall&mdash;and I promise it&mdash;what
      a Paradise, when the good God helps, an old fool&rsquo;s dream can make!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A half-light had broken upon me as he talked, pacing the floor, thundering
      his paean of triumph, his Titanic gestures bruising the harmless air. Only
      one explanation, incredible, but possible, sufficed. Anything was
      possible, I thought&mdash;anything was probable&mdash;with this dreamer
      whom the trump of Fame, executing a whimsical fantasia, proclaimed a man
      of science!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the wildest chance,&rdquo; I gasped, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t mean
      that you wanted him to fall in love&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had reached the other end of the room, but at this he whirled about on
      me, his laughter rolling out again, till it might have been heard at Pere
      Baudry&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, my dear sir, you have said it! But you knew it; you told him to
      come to me and tell me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I mean that you&mdash;unless I utterly misunderstand&mdash;you
      seem to imply that you had selected some one now in France whom you
      planned that he should care for&mdash;that you had selected the lady whom
      you know as Madame d&rsquo;Armand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;you have said it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Professor Keredec,&rdquo; I returned, with asperity, &ldquo;I have
      no idea how you came to conceive such a preposterous scheme, but I agree
      heartily that the word for it is madness. In the first place, I must tell
      you that her name is not even d&rsquo;Armand&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, I know. It was the mistake of that absurd Amedee. She
      is Mrs. Harman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew it?&rdquo; I cried, hopelessly confused. &ldquo;But Oliver
      still speaks of her as Madame d&rsquo;Armand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does not know. She has not told him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why haven&rsquo;t you told him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, that is a story, a poem,&rdquo; he cried, beginning to pace the
      floor again&mdash;&ldquo;a ballad as old as the oldest of Provence! There
      is a reason, my dear sir, which I cannot tell you, but it lies within the
      romance of what you agree is my madness. Some day, I hope, you shall
      understand and applaud! In the meantime&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the meantime,&rdquo; I said sharply, as he paused for breath,
      &ldquo;there is a keen-faced young man who took a room in the inn this
      morning and who has come to spy upon you, I believe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He came to a sudden stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had not meant to deliver my information quite so abruptly, but there was
      no help for it now, and I repeated the statement, giving him a terse
      account of my two encounters with the rattish youth, and adding:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seemed to be certain that &lsquo;Oliver Saffren&rsquo; is an
      assumed name, and he made a threatening reference to the laws of France.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect upon Keredec was a very distinct pallor. He faced me silently
      until I had finished, then in a voice grown suddenly husky, asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he came back to the inn? Is he here now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must learn; I must know that, at once.&rdquo; And he went to the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go instead,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t make little difference if he see me,&rdquo; said the
      professor, swallowing with difficulty and displaying, as he turned to me,
      a look of such profound anxiety that I was as sorry for him now as I had
      been irritated a few minutes earlier by his galliard air-castles. &ldquo;I
      do not know this man, nor does he know me, but I have fear&rdquo;&mdash;his
      beard moved as though his chin were trembling&mdash;&ldquo;I have fear
      that I know his employers. Still, it may be better if you go. Bring
      somebody here that we can ask.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I find Amedee?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no! That babbler? Find Madame Brossard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I stepped out to the gallery, to discover Madame Brossard emerging from a
      door on the opposite side of the courtyard; Amedee, Glouglou, and a couple
      of carters deploying before her with some light trunks and bags, which
      they were carrying into the passage she had just quitted. I summoned her
      quietly; she came briskly up the steps and into the room, and I closed the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame Brossard,&rdquo; said the professor, &ldquo;you have a new
      client to-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That monsieur who arrived this morning,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was an American,&rdquo; said the hostess, knitting her dark
      brows&mdash;&ldquo;but I do not think that he was exactly a monsieur.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; I murmured. &ldquo;That sketches a likeness. It is
      this &lsquo;Percy&rsquo; without a doubt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is it,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;Monsieur Poissy is the name
      he gave.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he at the inn now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur, but two friends for whom he engaged apartments have
      just arrived.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; asked Keredec quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a lady and a monsieur from Paris. But not married: they have
      taken separate apartments and she has a domestic with her, a negress,
      Algerian.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are their names?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not ten minutes that they are installed. They have not given
      me their names.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the lady&rsquo;s appearance?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur the Professor,&rdquo; replied the hostess demurely,
      &ldquo;she is not beautiful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is she?&rdquo; demanded Keredec impatiently; and it could
      be seen that he was striving to control a rising agitation. &ldquo;Is she
      blonde? Is she brunette? Is she young? Is she old? Is she French, English,
      Spanish&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Madame Brossard, &ldquo;I think one would call
      her Spanish, but she is very fat, not young, and with a great deal too
      much rouge&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped with an audible intake of breath, staring at my friend&rsquo;s
      white face. &ldquo;Eh! it is bad news?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;And when
      one has been so ill&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Keredec checked her with an imperious gesture. &ldquo;Monsieur Saffren and
      I leave at once,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I shall meet him on the road; he
      will not return to the inn. We go to&mdash;to Trouville. See that no one
      knows that we have gone until to-morrow, if possible; I shall leave fees
      for the servants with you. Go now, prepare your bill, and bring it to me
      at once. I shall write you where to send our trunks. Quick! And you, my
      friend&rdquo;&mdash;he turned to me as Madame Brossard, obviously
      distressed and frightened, but none the less intelligent for that,
      skurried away to do his bidding&mdash;&ldquo;my friend, will you help us?
      For we need it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything in the world!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to Pere Baudry&rsquo;s; have him put the least tired of his
      three horses to his lightest cart and wait in the road beyond the cottage.
      Stand in the road yourself while that is being done. Oliver will come that
      way; detain him. I will join you there; I have only to see to my papers&mdash;at
      the most, twenty minutes. Go quickly, my friend!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I strode to the door and out to the gallery. I was half-way down the steps
      before I saw that Oliver Saffren was already in the courtyard, coming
      toward me from the archway with a light and buoyant step.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up, waving his hat to me, his face lighted with a happiness most
      remarkable, and brighter, even, than the strong, midsummer sunshine
      flaming over him. Dressed in white as he was, and with the air of victory
      he wore, he might have been, at that moment, a figure from some marble
      triumph; youthful, conquering&mdash;crowned with the laurel.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had time only to glance at him, to &ldquo;take&rdquo; him, as it were,
      between two shutter-flicks of the instantaneous eyelid, and with him, the
      courtyard flooded with sunshine, the figure of Madame Brossard emerging
      from her little office, Amedee coming from the kitchen bearing a
      white-covered tray, and, entering from the road, upon the trail of Saffren
      but still in the shadow of the archway, the discordant fineries and
      hatchet-face of the ex-pedestrian and tourist, my antagonist of the
      forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had opened my mouth to call a warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurry&rdquo; was the word I would have said, but it stopped at
      &ldquo;hur&mdash;.&rdquo; The second syllable was never uttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a violent outcry, raucous and shrill as the wail of a captured
      hen, and out of the passage across the courtyard floundered a woman,
      fantastically dressed in green and gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her coarse blue-black hair fell dishevelled upon her shoulders, from which
      her gown hung precariously unfastened, as if she had abandoned her toilet
      half-way. She was abundantly fat, double-chinned, coarse, greasy, smeared
      with blue pencillings, carmine, enamel, and rouge.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the scream Saffren turned. She made straight at him, crying wildly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enfin! Mon mari, mon mari&mdash;c&rsquo;est moi! C&rsquo;est ta
      femme, mon coeur!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw herself upon him, her arms about his neck, with a tropical
      ferocity that was a very paroxysm of triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Embrasse moi, Larrabi! Embrasse moi!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horrified, outraged, his eyes blazing, he flung her off with a violence
      surpassing her own, and with loathing unspeakable. She screamed that he
      was killing her, calling him &ldquo;husband,&rdquo; and tried to fasten
      herself upon him again. But he leaped backward beyond the reach of her
      clutching hands, and, turning, plunged to the steps and staggered up them,
      the woman following.
    </p>
    <p>
      From above me leaned the stricken face of Keredec; he caught Saffren under
      the arm and half lifted him to the gallery, while she strove to hold him
      by the knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Christ!&rdquo; gasped Saffren. &ldquo;Is THIS the woman?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The giant swung him across the gallery and into the open door with one
      great sweep of the arm, strode in after him, and closed and bolted the
      door. The woman fell in a heap at the foot of the steps, uttered a cracked
      simulation of the cry of a broken heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name of a name of God!&rdquo; she wailed. &ldquo;After all these
      years! And my husband strikes me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it was that what had been in my mind as a monstrous suspicion became
      a certainty. For I recognised the woman; she was Mariana&mdash;la bella
      Mariana la Mursiana.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I had ever known Larrabee Harman, if, instead of the two strange
      glimpses I had caught of him, I had been familiar with his gesture, walk,
      intonation&mdash;even, perhaps, if I had ever heard his voice&mdash;the
      truth might have come to me long ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Larrabee Harman!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oliver Saffren&rdquo; was Larrabee Harman.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      I do not like to read those poets who write of pain as if they loved it;
      the study of suffering is for the cold analyst, for the vivisectionist,
      for those who may transfuse their knowledge of it to the ultimate good of
      mankind. And although I am so heavily endowed with curiosity concerning
      the people I find about me, my gift (or curse, whichever it be) knows
      pause at the gates of the house of calamity. So, if it were possible, I
      would not speak of the agony of which I was a witness that night in the
      apartment of my friends at Madame Brossard&rsquo;s. I went with
      reluctance, but there was no choice. Keredec had sent for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      ... When I was about fifteen, a boy cousin of mine, several years younger,
      terribly injured himself on the Fourth of July; and I sat all night in the
      room with him, helping his mother. Somehow he had learned that there was
      no hope of saving his sight; he was an imaginative child and realised the
      whole meaning of the catastrophe; the eternal darkness.... And he
      understood that the thing had been done, that there was no going back of
      it. This very certainty increased the intensity of his rebellion a
      thousandfold. &ldquo;I WILL have my eyes!&rdquo; he screamed. &ldquo;I
      WILL! I WILL!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Keredec had told his tragic ward too little. The latter had understood but
      vaguely the nature of the catastrophe which overhung his return to France,
      and now that it was indeed concrete and definite, the guardian was forced
      into fuller disclosures, every word making the anguish of the listener
      more intolerable. It was the horizonless despair of a child; and that
      profound protest I had so often seen smouldering in his eyes culminated,
      at its crisis, in a wild flame of revolt. The shame of the revelation
      passed over him; there was nothing of the disastrous drunkard, sober,
      learning what he had done. To him, it seemed that he was being forced to
      suffer for the sins of another man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think that you can make me believe <i>I</i> did this?&rdquo;
      he cried. &ldquo;That I made life unbearable for HER, drove HER from me,
      and took this hideous, painted old woman in HER place? It&rsquo;s a lie.
      You can&rsquo;t make me believe such a monstrous lie as that! You CAN&rsquo;T!
      You CAN&rsquo;T!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw himself violently upon the couch, face downward, shuddering from
      head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor boy, it is the truth,&rdquo; said Keredec, kneeling beside
      him and putting a great arm across his shoulders. &ldquo;It is what a
      thousand men are doing this night. Nothing is more common, or more
      unexplainable&mdash;or more simple. Of all the nations it is the same,
      wherever life has become artificial and the poor, foolish young men have
      too much money and nothing to do. You do not understand it, but our friend
      here, and I, we understand because we remember what we have been seeing
      all our life. You say it is not you who did such crazy, horrible things,
      and you are right. When this poor woman who is so painted and greasy first
      caught you, when you began to give your money and your time and your life
      to her, when she got you into this horrible marriage with her, you were
      blind&mdash;you went staggering, in a bad dream; your soul hid away, far
      down inside you, with its hands over its face. If it could have once stood
      straight, if the eyes of your body could have once been clean for it to
      look through, if you could have once been as you are to-day, or as you
      were when you were a little child, you would have cry out with horror both
      of her and of yourself, as you do now; and you would have run away from
      her and from everything you had put in your life. But, in your suffering
      you must rejoice: the triumph is that your mind hates that old life as
      greatly as your soul hates it. You are as good as if you had never been
      the wild fellow&mdash;yes, the wicked fellow&mdash;that you were. For a
      man who shakes off his sin is clean; he stands as pure as if he had never
      sinned. But though his emancipation can be so perfect, there is a law that
      he cannot escape from the result of all the bad and foolish things he has
      done, for every act, every breath you draw, is immortal, and each has a
      consequence that is never ending. And so, now, though you are purified,
      the suffering from these old actions is here, and you must abide it. Ah,
      but that is a little thing, nothing!&mdash;that suffering&mdash;compared
      to what you have gained, for you have gained your own soul!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The desperate young man on the couch answered only with the sobbing of a
      broken-hearted child.
    </p>
    <p>
      I came back to my pavilion after midnight, but I did not sleep, though I
      lay upon my bed until dawn. Then I went for a long, hard walk, breakfasted
      at Dives, and begged a ride back to Madame Brossard&rsquo;s in a peasant&rsquo;s
      cart which was going that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found George Ward waiting for me on the little veranda of the pavilion,
      looking handsomer and more prosperously distinguished and distinguishedly
      prosperous and generally well-conditioned than ever&mdash;as I told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have some news for you,&rdquo; he said after the hearty greeting&mdash;&ldquo;an
      announcement, in fact.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; I glanced at the interested attitude of Mr. Earl
      Percy, who was breakfasting at a table significantly near the gallery
      steps, and led the way into the pavilion. &ldquo;You may as well not tell
      it in the hearing of that young man,&rdquo; I said, when the door was
      closed. &ldquo;He is eccentric.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I gathered,&rdquo; returned Ward, smiling, &ldquo;from his
      attire. But it really wouldn&rsquo;t matter who heard it. Elizabeth&rsquo;s
      going to marry Cresson Ingle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the news&mdash;the announcement&mdash;you spoke of?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To save my life I could not have told at that moment what else I had
      expected, or feared, that he might say, but certainly I took a deep breath
      of relief. &ldquo;I am very glad,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It should be a
      happy alliance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the whole, I think it will be,&rdquo; he returned thoughtfully.
      &ldquo;Ingle&rsquo;s done his share of hard living, and I once had a
      notion&rdquo;&mdash;he glanced smiling at me&mdash;&ldquo;well, I dare say
      you know my notion. But it is a good match for Elizabeth and not without
      advantages on many counts. You see, it&rsquo;s time I married, myself; she
      feels that very strongly and I think her decision to accept Ingle is
      partly due to her wish to make all clear for a new mistress of my
      household,&mdash;though that&rsquo;s putting it in a rather grandiloquent
      way.&rdquo; He laughed. &ldquo;And as you probably guess, I have an idea
      that some such arrangement might be somewhere on the wings of the wind on
      its way to me, before long.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed again, but I did not, and noting my silence he turned upon me a
      more scrutinising look than he had yet given me, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, is something the matter? You look quite haggard.
      You haven&rsquo;t been ill?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve had a bad night. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I heard something of a riotous scene taking place over here,&rdquo;
      he said. &ldquo;One of the gardeners was talking about it to Elizabeth.
      Your bad night wouldn&rsquo;t be connected with that, would it? You haven&rsquo;t
      been playing Samaritan?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it you heard?&rdquo; I asked quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention. He said that there was great
      excitement at Madame Brossard&rsquo;s, because a strange woman had turned
      up and claimed an insane young man at the inn for her husband, and that
      they had a fight of some sort&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damnation!&rdquo; I started from my chair. &ldquo;Did Mrs. Harman
      hear this story?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not last night, I&rsquo;m certain. Elizabeth said the gardener told
      her as she came down to the chateau gates to meet me when I arrived&mdash;it
      was late, and Louise had already gone to her room. In fact, I have not
      seen her yet. But what difference could it possibly make whether she heard
      it or not? She doesn&rsquo;t know these people, surely?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She knows the man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This insane&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not insane,&rdquo; I interrupted. &ldquo;He has lost the
      memory of his earlier life&mdash;lost it through an accident. You and I
      saw the accident.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; said George, frowning. &ldquo;I
      never saw but one accident that you&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the one: the man is Larrabee Harman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      George had struck a match to light a cigar; but the operation remained
      incomplete: he dropped the match upon the floor and set his foot upon it.
      &ldquo;Well, tell me about it,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t heard anything about him since the accident?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that he did eventually recover and was taken away from the
      hospital. I heard that his mind was impaired. Does Louise&mdash;&rdquo; he
      began; stopped, and cleared his throat. &ldquo;Has Mrs. Harman heard that
      he is here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; she has seen him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean the scoundrel has been bothering her? Elizabeth didn&rsquo;t
      tell me of this&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sister doesn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I said, lifting my hand to
      check him. &ldquo;I think you ought to understand the whole case&mdash;if
      you&rsquo;ll let me tell you what I know about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; he bade me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to listen
      patiently, though the very thought of the fellow has always set my teeth
      on edge.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not at all what you think,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      an enormous difference, almost impossible to explain to you, but something
      you&rsquo;d understand at once if you saw him. It&rsquo;s such a
      difference, in fact, that when I found that he was Larrabee Harman the
      revelation was inexpressibly shocking and distressing to me. He came here
      under another name; I had no suspicion that he was any one I&rsquo;d ever
      heard of, much less that I&rsquo;d actually seen him twice, two years ago,
      and I&rsquo;ve grown to&mdash;well, in truth, to be fond of him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the change?&rdquo; asked Ward, and his voice showed that he
      was greatly disquieted. &ldquo;What is he like?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As well as I can tell you, he&rsquo;s like an odd but very engaging
      boy, with something pathetic about him; quite splendidly handsome&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he had good looks to spare when I first knew him,&rdquo; George
      said bitterly. &ldquo;I dare say he&rsquo;s got them back if he&rsquo;s
      taken care of himself, or been taken care OF, rather! But go on; I won&rsquo;t
      interrupt you again. Why did he come here? Hoping to see&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. When he came here he did not know of her existence except in
      the vaguest way. But to go back to that, I&rsquo;d better tell you first
      that the woman we saw with him, one day on the boulevard, and who was in
      the accident with him&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La Mursiana, the dancer; I know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had got him to go through a marriage with her&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WHAT?&rdquo; Ward&rsquo;s eyes flashed as he shouted the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems inexplicable; but as I understand it, he was never quite
      sober at that time; he had begun to use drugs, and was often in a
      half-stupefied condition. As a matter of fact, the woman did what she
      pleased with him. There&rsquo;s no doubt about the validity of the
      marriage. And what makes it so desperate a muddle is that since the
      marriage she&rsquo;s taken good care to give no grounds upon which a
      divorce could be obtained for Harman. She means to hang on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of that!&rdquo; said George, striking his knee with
      his open palm. &ldquo;That will go a great way toward&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and asked suddenly: &ldquo;Did this marriage take place in
      France?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You&rsquo;d better hear me through,&rdquo; I remonstrated.
      &ldquo;When he was taken from the hospital, he was placed in charge of a
      Professor Keredec, a madman of whom you&rsquo;ve probably heard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madman? Why, no; he&rsquo;s a member of the Institute; a
      psychologist or metaphysician, isn&rsquo;t he?&mdash;at any rate of
      considerable celebrity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; I insisted grimly, &ldquo;as misty a vapourer
      as I ever saw; a poetic, self-contradicting and inconsistent orator, a
      blower of bubbles, a seer of visions, a mystic, and a dreamer&mdash;about
      as scientific as Alice&rsquo;s White Knight! Harman&rsquo;s aunt, who
      lived in London, the only relative he had left, I believe&mdash;and she
      has died since&mdash;put him in Keredec&rsquo;s charge, and he was taken
      up into the Tyrol and virtually hidden for two years, the idea being
      literally to give him something like an education&mdash;Keredec&rsquo;s
      phrase is &lsquo;restore mind to his soul&rsquo;! What must have been
      quite as vital was to get him out of his horrible wife&rsquo;s clutches.
      And they did it, for she could not find him. But she picked up that rat in
      the garden out yonder&mdash;he&rsquo;d been some sort of stable-manager
      for Harman once&mdash;and set him on the track. He ran the poor boy down,
      and yesterday she followed him. Now it amounts to a species of sordid
      siege.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wants money, of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, MORE money; a fair allowance has always been sent to her.
      Keredec has interviewed her notary and she wants a settlement, naming a
      sum actually larger than the whole estate amounts to. There were colossal
      expenditures and equally large shrinkages; what he has left is invested in
      English securities and is not a fortune, but of course she won&rsquo;t
      believe that and refuses to budge until this impossible settlement is
      made. You can imagine about how competent such a man as Keredec would be
      to deal with the situation. In the mean time, his ward is in so dreadful a
      state of horror and grief I am afraid it is possible that his mind may
      really give way, for it was not in a normal condition, of course, though
      he&rsquo;s perfectly sane, as I tell you. If it should,&rdquo; I
      concluded, with some bitterness, &ldquo;I suppose Keredec will be still
      prating upliftingly on the saving of his soul!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When was it that Louise saw him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is where Keredec has been a poet
      and a dreamer indeed. It was his PLAN that they should meet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean he brought this wreck of Harman, these husks and shreds of
      a man, down here for Louise to see?&rdquo; Ward cried incredulously.
      &ldquo;Oh, monstrous!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Only insane. Not because there is
      anything lacking in Oliver&mdash;in Harman, I mean&mdash;for I think that
      will be righted in time, but because the second marriage makes it a
      useless cruelty that he should have been allowed to fall in love with his
      first wife again. Yet that was Keredec&rsquo;s idea of a &lsquo;beautiful
      restoration,&rsquo; as he calls it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something behind all this that you don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo;
      said Ward slowly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you after I&rsquo;ve seen this
      Keredec. When did the man make you his confidant?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last night. Most of what I learned was as much a revelation to his
      victim as it was to me. Harman did not know till then that the lady he had
      been meeting had been his wife, or that he had ever seen her before he
      came here. He had mistaken her name and she did not enlighten him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meeting?&rdquo; said Ward harshly. &ldquo;You speak as if&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have been meeting every day, George.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t believe it of her!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true. He spoke to her in the woods one day; I was there
      and saw it. I know now that she knew him at once; and she ran away, but&mdash;not
      in anger. I shouldn&rsquo;t be a very good friend of yours,&rdquo; I went
      on gently, &ldquo;if I didn&rsquo;t give you the truth. They&rsquo;ve been
      together every day since then, and I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;miserably
      afraid, Ward&mdash;that her old feeling for him has been revived.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I have heard Ward use an oath only two or three times in my life, and this
      was one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, by God!&rdquo; he cried, starting to his feet; &ldquo;I SHOULD
      like to meet Professor Keredec!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am at your service, my dear sir,&rdquo; said a deep voice from
      the veranda. And opening the door, the professor walked into the room.

      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      He looked old and tired and sad; it was plain that he expected attack and
      equally plain that he would meet it with fanatic serenity. And yet, the
      magnificent blunderer presented so fine an aspect of the tortured
      Olympian, he confronted us with so vast a dignity&mdash;the driven snow of
      his hair tousled upon his head and shoulders, like a storm in the higher
      altitudes&mdash;that he regained, in my eyes, something of his mountain
      grandeur before he had spoken a word in defence. But sympathy is not what
      one should be entertaining for an antagonist; therefore I said cavalierly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Mr. Ward, Professor Keredec. He is Mrs. Harman&rsquo;s
      cousin and close friend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had divined it.&rdquo; The professor made a French bow, and
      George responded with as slight a salutation as it has been my lot to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were speaking of your reasons,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;for
      bringing Mr. Harman to this place. Frankly, we were questioning your
      motive.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My motives? I have wished to restore to two young people the
      paradise which they had lost&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ward uttered an exclamation none the less violent because it was
      half-suppressed, while, for my part, I laughed outright; and as Keredec
      turned his eyes questioningly upon me, I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Professor Keredec, you&rsquo;d better understand at once that I
      mean to help undo the harm you&rsquo;ve done. I couldn&rsquo;t tell you
      last night, in Harman&rsquo;s presence, but I think you&rsquo;re
      responsible for the whole ghastly tragi-comedy&mdash;as hopeless a tangle
      as ever was made on this earth!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was even more roughly spoken than I had intended, but it did not
      cause him to look less mildly upon me, nor was there the faintest shadow
      of resentment in his big voice when he replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this world things may be tangled, they may be sad, yet they may
      be good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that seems rather a trite generality. I beg you to
      remember that plain-speaking is of some importance just now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall remember.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we should be glad of the explanation,&rdquo; said Ward,
      resting his arms on my table and leaning across it toward Keredec.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should, indeed,&rdquo; I echoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is simple,&rdquo; began the professor. &ldquo;I learned my poor
      boy&rsquo;s history well, from those who could tell me, from his papers&mdash;yes,
      and from the bundles of old-time letters which were given me&mdash;since
      it was necessary that I should know everything. From all these I learned
      what a strong and beautiful soul was that lady who loved him so much that
      she ran away from her home for his sake. Helas! he was already the slave
      of what was bad and foolish, he had gone too far from himself, was
      overlaid with the habit of evil, and she could not save him then. The
      spirit was dying in him, although it was there, and IT was good&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ward&rsquo;s acrid laughter rang out in the room, and my admiration went
      unwillingly to Keredec for the way he took it, which was to bow gravely,
      as if acknowledging the other&rsquo;s right to his own point of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will study the antique busts,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you
      will find that Socrates is Silenus dignified. I choose to believe in the
      infinite capacities of all men&mdash;and in the spirit in all. And so I
      try to restore my poor boy his capacities and his spirit. But that was not
      all. The time was coming when I could do no more for him, when the little
      education of books would be finish&rsquo; and he must go out in the world
      again to learn&mdash;all newly&mdash;how to make of himself a man of use.
      That is the time of danger, and the thought was troubling me when I
      learned that Madame Harman was here, near this inn, of which I knew. So I
      brought him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The inconceivable selfishness, the devilish brutality of it!&rdquo;
      Ward&rsquo;s face was scarlet. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t care how you
      sacrificed her&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sacrificed!&rdquo; The professor suddenly released the huge volume
      of his voice. &ldquo;Sacrificed!&rdquo; he thundered. &ldquo;If I could
      give him back to her as he is now, it would be restoring to her all that
      she had loved in him, the real SELF of him! It would be the greatest gift
      in her life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak for her?&rdquo; demanded Ward, the question coming like a
      lawyer&rsquo;s. It failed to disturb Keredec, who replied quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a quibble. I speak for her, yes, my dear sir. Her action in
      defiance of her family and her friends proved the strength of what she
      felt for the man she married; that she have remained with him three years&mdash;until
      it was impossible&mdash;proved its persistence; her letters, which I read
      with reverence, proved its beauty&mdash;to me. It was a living passion,
      one that could not die. To let them see each other again; that was all I
      intended. To give them their new chance&mdash;and then, for myself, to
      keep out of the way. That was why&mdash;&rdquo; he turned to me&mdash;&ldquo;that
      was why I have been guilty of pretending to have that bad rheumatism, and
      I hope you will not think it an ugly trick of me! It was to give him his
      chance freely; and though at first I had much anxiety, it was done. In
      spite of all his wicked follies theirs had been a true love, and nothing
      in this world could be more inevitable than that they should come together
      again if the chance could be given. And they HAVE, my dear sirs! It has so
      happened. To him it has been a wooing as if for the first time; so she has
      preferred it, keeping him to his mistake of her name. She feared that if
      he knew that it was the same as his own he might ask questions of me, and,
      you see, she did not know that I had made this little plan, and was afraid&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are not questioning Mrs. Harman&rsquo;s motives,&rdquo; George
      interrupted hotly, &ldquo;but YOURS!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, my dear sir; that is all. I have explained them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have?&rdquo; I interjected. &ldquo;Then, my dear Keredec,
      either you are really insane or I am! You knew that this poor, unfortunate
      devil of a Harman was tied to that hyenic prowler yonder who means to
      fatten on him, and will never release him; you knew that. Then why did you
      bring him down here to fall in love with a woman he can never have? In
      pity&rsquo;s name, if you didn&rsquo;t hope to half kill them both, what
      DID you mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; interposed George quickly, &ldquo;you
      underrate Professor Keredec&rsquo;s shrewdness. His plans are not so
      simple as you think. He knows that my cousin Louise never obtained a
      divorce from her husband.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; I said, not immediately comprehending his meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Mrs. Harman never obtained a divorce.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you delirious?&rdquo; I gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the truth; she never did.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw a notice of it at the time. &lsquo;A notice?&rsquo; I saw a
      hundred!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. What you saw was that she had made an application for divorce.
      Her family got her that far and then she revolted. The suit was dropped.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true, indeed,&rdquo; said Keredec. &ldquo;The poor boy was on
      the other side of the world, and he thought it was granted. He had been
      bad before, but from that time he cared nothing what became of him. That
      was the reason this Spanish woman&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned upon him sharply. &ldquo;YOU knew it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a year that I have known it; when his estate was&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t you tell me last night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, I could not in HIS presence, because it is one thing I
      dare not let him know. This Spanish woman is so hideous, her claim upon
      him is so horrible to him I could not hope to control him&mdash;he would
      shout it out to her that she cannot call him husband. God knows what he
      would do!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why shouldn&rsquo;t he shout it out to her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not understand,&rdquo; George interposed again, &ldquo;that
      what Professor Keredec risked for his &lsquo;poor boy,&rsquo; in returning
      to France, was a trial on the charge of bigamy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The professor recoiled from the definite brutality. &ldquo;My dear sir! It
      is not possible that such a thing can happen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I conceive it very likely to happen,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;unless
      you get him out of the country before the lady now installed here as his
      wife discovers the truth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she must not!&rdquo; Keredec lifted both hands toward Ward
      appealingly; they trembled, and his voice betrayed profound agitation.
      &ldquo;She cannot! She has never suspected such a thing; there is nothing
      that could MAKE her suspect it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One particular thing would be my telling her,&rdquo; said Ward
      quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; cried the professor, stepping back from him. &ldquo;You
      could not do that!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I not only could, but I will, unless you get him out of the country&mdash;and
      quickly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George!&rdquo; I exclaimed, coming forward between them. &ldquo;This
      won&rsquo;t do at all. You can&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; he said, waving me back, and I saw that
      his hand was shaking, too, like Keredec&rsquo;s. His face had grown very
      white; but he controlled himself to speak with a coolness that made what
      he said painfully convincing. &ldquo;I know what you think,&rdquo; he went
      on, addressing me, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;re wrong. It isn&rsquo;t for
      myself. When I sailed for New York in the spring I thought there was a
      chance that she would carry out the action she begun four years ago and go
      through the form of ridding herself of him definitely; that is, I thought
      there was some hope for me; I believed there was until this morning. But I
      know better now. If she&rsquo;s seen him again, and he&rsquo;s been
      anything except literally unbearable, it&rsquo;s all over with ME. From
      the first, I never had a chance against him; he was a hard rival, even
      when he&rsquo;d become only a cruel memory.&rdquo; His voice rose. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      lived a sober, decent life, and I&rsquo;ve treated HER with gentleness and
      reverence since she was born, and HE&rsquo;S done nothing but make a
      stew-pan of his life and neglect and betray her when he had her. Heaven
      knows why it is; it isn&rsquo;t because of anything he&rsquo;s done or
      has, it&rsquo;s just because it&rsquo;s HIM, I suppose, but I know my
      chance is gone for good! THAT leaves me free to act for her; no one can
      accuse me of doing it for myself. And I swear she sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t go
      through that slough of despond again while I have breath in my body!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady, George!&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m steady enough,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Professor
      Keredec shall be convinced of it! My cousin is not going into the mire
      again; she shall be freed of it for ever: I speak as her relative now, the
      representative of her family and of those who care for her happiness and
      good. Now she SHALL make the separation definite&mdash;and LEGAL! And let
      Professor Keredec get his &lsquo;poor boy&rsquo; out of the country. Let
      him do it quickly! I make it as a condition of my not informing the woman
      yonder and her lawyer. And by my hope of salvation I warn you&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George, for pity&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; I shouted, throwing my arm
      about his shoulders, for his voice had risen to a pitch of excitement and
      fury that I feared must bring the whole place upon us. He caught himself
      up suddenly, stared at me blankly for a moment, then sank into a chair
      with a groan. As he did so I became aware of a sound that had been
      worrying my subconsciousness for an indefinite length of time, and
      realised what it was. Some one was knocking for admission.
    </p>
    <p>
      I crossed the room and opened the door. Miss Elizabeth stood there,
      red-faced and flustered, and behind her stood Mr. Cresson Ingle, who
      looked dubiously amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;come in,&rdquo; I said awkwardly. &ldquo;George is here.
      Let me present Professor Keredec&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;George is here!&rsquo;&rdquo; echoed Miss Elizabeth,
      interrupting, and paying no attention whatever to an agitated bow on the
      part of the professor. &ldquo;I should say he WAS! They probably know THAT
      all the way to Trouville!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were discussing&mdash;&rdquo; I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I know what you were discussing,&rdquo; she said impatiently.
      &ldquo;Come in, Cresson.&rdquo; She turned to Mr. Ingle, who was obviously
      reluctant. &ldquo;It is a family matter, and you&rsquo;ll have to go
      through with it now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That reminds me,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;May I offer&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now!&rdquo; Miss Elizabeth cut short a rather embarrassed
      handshake which her betrothed and I were exchanging. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a
      very nervous and distressed state of mind, as I suppose we all are, for
      that matter. This morning I learned the true situation over here; and I&rsquo;m
      afraid Louise has heard; at least she&rsquo;s not at Quesnay. I got into a
      panic for fear she had come here, but thank heaven she does not seem to&mdash;Good
      gracious! What&rsquo;s THAT?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the discordant voice of Mariana la Mursiana, crackling in strident
      protest. My door was still open; I turned to look and saw her, hot-faced,
      tousle-haired, insufficiently wrapped, striving to ascend the gallery
      steps, but valiantly opposed by Madame Brossard, who stood in the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But NO, madame,&rdquo; insisted Madame Brossard, excited but darkly
      determined. &ldquo;You cannot ascend. There is nothing on the upper floor
      of this wing except the apartment of Professor Keredec.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name of a dog!&rdquo; shrilled the other. &ldquo;It is my husband&rsquo;s
      apartment, I tell you. Il y a une femme avec lui!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Madame Harman who is there,&rdquo; said Keredec hoarsely in
      my ear. &ldquo;I came away and left them together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; I said, and, letting the others think what they would,
      sprang across the veranda, the professor beside me, and ran toward the two
      women who were beginning to struggle with more than their tongues. I
      leaped by them and up the steps, but Keredec thrust himself between our
      hostess and her opponent, planting his great bulk on the lowest step.
      Glancing hurriedly over my shoulder, I saw the Spanish woman strike him
      furiously upon the breast with both hands, but I knew she would never pass
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I entered the salon of the &ldquo;Grande Suite,&rdquo; and closed the door
      quickly behind me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louise Harman was standing at the other end of the room; she wore the
      pretty dress of white and lilac and the white hat. She looked cool and
      beautiful and good, and there were tears in her eyes. To come into this
      quiet chamber and see her so, after the hot sunshine and tawdry scene
      below, was like leaving the shouting market-place for a shadowy chapel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband was kneeling beside her; he held one of her hands in both his,
      her other rested upon his head; and something in their attitudes made me
      know I had come in upon their leave-taking. But from the face he lifted
      toward her all trace of his tragedy had passed: the wonder and worship
      written there left no room for anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Harman&mdash;&rdquo; I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am coming.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want you to. I&rsquo;ve come for fear you would,
      and you&mdash;you must not,&rdquo; I stammered. &ldquo;You must wait.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s necessary,&rdquo; I floundered. &ldquo;There is a scene&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;THAT must be, of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Harman rose, and she took both his hands, holding them against her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said gently,&mdash;&ldquo;my dearest, you must
      stay. Will you promise not to pass that door, even, until you have word
      from me again?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered huskily, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll promise it
      SHALL come&mdash;some day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall, indeed. Be sure of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I had turned away, but I heard the ghost of his voice whispering &ldquo;good-bye.&rdquo;
      Then she was beside me and opening the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to stay her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Harman,&rdquo; I urged, &ldquo;I earnestly beg you&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;this is better.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She stepped out upon the gallery; I followed, and she closed the door.
      Upon the veranda of my pavilion were my visitors from Quesnay, staring up
      at us apprehensively; Madame Brossard and Keredec still held the foot of
      the steps, but la Mursiana had abandoned the siege, and, accompanied by
      Mr. Percy and Rameau, the black-bearded notary, who had joined her, was
      crossing the garden toward her own apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of the closing door, she glanced over her shoulder, sent
      forth a scream, and, whirling about, ran viciously for the steps, where
      she was again blocked by the indomitable Keredec.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you foolish woman, I know who you are,&rdquo; she cried,
      stepping back from him to shake a menacing hand at the quiet lady by my
      side. &ldquo;You want to get yourself into trouble! That man in the room
      up there has been my husband these two years and more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madame,&rdquo; said Louise Harman, &ldquo;you are mistaken; he
      is my husband.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you divorced him,&rdquo; vociferated the other wildly. &ldquo;You
      divorced him in America!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. You are mistaken,&rdquo; the quiet voice replied. &ldquo;The
      suit was withdrawn. He is still my husband.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard the professor&rsquo;s groan of despair, but it was drowned in the
      wild shriek of Mariana. &ldquo;WHAT? You tell ME that? Ah, the miserable!
      If what you say is true, he shall pay bitterly! He shall wish that he had
      died by fire! What! You think he can marry ME, break my leg so that I
      cannot dance again, ruin my career, and then go away with a pretty woman
      like you and be happy? Aha, there are prisons in France for people who
      marry two like that; I do not know what they do in YOUR barbaric country,
      but they are decent people over here and they punish. He shall pay for it
      in suffering&mdash;&rdquo; her voice rose to an incredible and unbearable
      shriek&mdash;&ldquo;and you, YOU shall pay, too! You can&rsquo;t come
      stealing honest women&rsquo;s husbands like that. You shall PAY!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw George Ward come running forward with his hand upraised in a gesture
      of passionate warning, for Mrs. Harman, unnoticed by me&mdash;I was
      watching the Spanish woman&mdash;had descended the steps and had passed
      Keredec, walking straight to Mariana. I leaped down after her, my heart in
      my throat, fearing a thousand things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not talk like that,&rdquo; she said, not lifting her voice&mdash;yet
      every one in the courtyard heard her distinctly. &ldquo;You can do neither
      of us any harm in the world.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is impossible to say what Mariana would have done had there been no
      interference, for she had worked herself into one of those furies which
      women of her type can attain when they feel the occasion demands it, a
      paroxysm none the less dangerous because its foundation is histrionic. But
      Rameau threw his arms about her; Mr. Percy came hastily to his assistance,
      and Ward and I sprang in between her and the too-fearless lady she strove
      to reach. Even at that, the finger-nails of Mariana&rsquo;s right hand
      touched the pretty white hat&mdash;but only touched it and no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rameau and the little spy managed to get their vociferating burden across
      the courtyard and into her own door, where she suddenly subsided,
      disappearing within the passage to her apartment in unexpected silence&mdash;indubitably
      a disappointment to the interested Amedee, to Glouglou, Francois, and the
      whole personnel of the inn, who hastened to group themselves about the
      door in attentive attitudes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In heaven&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; gasped Miss Elizabeth, seizing her
      cousin by the arm, &ldquo;come into the pavilion. Here&rsquo;s the whole
      world looking at us!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Professor Keredec&mdash;&rdquo; Mrs. Harman began, resisting, and
      turning to the professor appealingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, let him come too!&rdquo; said Miss Elizabeth desperately.
      &ldquo;Nothing could be worse than this!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She led the way back to the pavilion, and, refusing to consider a proposal
      on the part of Mr. Ingle and myself to remain outside, entered the room
      last, herself, producing an effect of &ldquo;shooing&rdquo; the rest of us
      in; closed the door with surprising force, relapsed in a chair, and burst
      into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a soul at Quesnay,&rdquo; sobbed the mortified chatelaine&mdash;&ldquo;not
      one but will know this before dinner! They&rsquo;ll hear the whole thing
      within two hours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there any way of stopping that, at least?&rdquo; Ward
      said to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None on earth, unless you go home at once and turn your visitors
      and THEIR servants out of the house,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing they shouldn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Harman.
    </p>
    <p>
      George turned to her with a smile so bravely managed that I was proud of
      him. &ldquo;Oh, yes, there is,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to
      get you out of all this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this?&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this MIRE!&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to get
      you out of it and keep you out of it, now, for good. I don&rsquo;t know
      whether your revelation to the Spanish woman will make that easier or
      harder, but I do know that it makes the mire deeper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For whom?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Harman. But you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t share it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her anxious eyes grew wider. &ldquo;How have I made it deeper for him?
      Wasn&rsquo;t it necessary that the poor woman should be told the truth?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Professor Keredec seemed to think it important that she shouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to Keredec with a frightened gesture and an unintelligible word
      of appeal, as if entreating him to deny what George had said. The
      professor&rsquo;s beard was trembling; he looked haggard; an almost
      pitiable apprehension hung upon his eyelids; but he came forward manfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you could never in your life do
      anything that would make harm. You were right to speak, and I had short
      sight to fear, since it was the truth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why did you fear it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was because&mdash;&rdquo; he began, and hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must know the reason,&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;I must know just
      what I&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was because,&rdquo; he repeated, running a nervous hand through
      his beard, &ldquo;because the knowledge would put us so utterly in this
      people&rsquo;s power. Already they demand more than we could give them;
      now they can&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can do what?&rdquo; she asked tremulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes rested gently on her blanched and stricken face. &ldquo;Nothing,
      my dear lady,&rdquo; he answered, swallowing painfully. &ldquo;Nothing
      that will last. I am an old man. I have seen and I have&mdash;I have
      thought. And I tell you that only the real survives; evil actions are some
      phantoms that disappear. They must not trouble us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a high plane,&rdquo; George intervened, and he spoke
      without sarcasm. &ldquo;To put it roughly, these people have been asking
      more than the Harman estate is worth; that was on the strength of the
      woman&rsquo;s claim as a wife; but now they know she is not one, her
      position is immensely strengthened, for she has only to go before the
      nearest Commissaire de Police&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; Mrs. Harman cried passionately. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
      done THAT! You mustn&rsquo;t tell me I have. You MUSTN&rsquo;T!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;There could not be a greater lie
      than to say you have done it. The responsibility is with the wretched and
      vicious boy who brought the catastrophe upon himself. But don&rsquo;t you
      see that you&rsquo;ve got to keep out of it, that we&rsquo;ve got to take
      you out of it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;m part of it; better or worse, it&rsquo;s
      as much mine as his.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; cried Miss Elizabeth. &ldquo;YOU mustn&rsquo;t tell
      us THAT!&rdquo; Still weeping, she sprang up and threw her arms about her
      brother. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too horrible of you&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is what I must tell you,&rdquo; Mrs. Harman said. &ldquo;My
      separation from my husband is over. I shall be with him now for&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t listen to you!&rdquo; Miss Elizabeth lifted her wet
      face from George&rsquo;s shoulder, and there was a note of deep anger in
      her voice. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about;
      you haven&rsquo;t the faintest idea of what a hideous situation that
      creature has made for himself. Don&rsquo;t you know that that awful woman
      was right, and there are laws in France? When she finds she can&rsquo;t
      get out of him all she wants, do you think she&rsquo;s going to let him
      off? I suppose she struck you as being quite the sort who&rsquo;d prove
      nobly magnanimous! Are you so blind you don&rsquo;t see exactly what&rsquo;s
      going to happen? She&rsquo;ll ask twice as much now as she did before; and
      the moment it&rsquo;s clear that she isn&rsquo;t going to get it, she&rsquo;ll
      call in an agent of police. She&rsquo;ll get her money in a separate suit
      and send him to prison to do it. The case against him is positive; there
      isn&rsquo;t a shadow of hope for him. You talk of being with him; don&rsquo;t
      you see how preposterous that is? Do you imagine they encourage family
      housekeeping in French prisons?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come, this won&rsquo;t do!&rdquo; The speaker was Cresson
      Ingle, who stepped forward, to my surprise; for he had been hovering in
      the background wearing an expression of thorough discomfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going much too far,&rdquo; he said, touching his
      betrothed upon the arm. &ldquo;My dear Elizabeth, there is no use
      exaggerating; the case is unpleasant enough just as it is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what have I exaggerated?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I KNEW Larrabee Harman,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;I knew him
      fairly well. I went as far as Honolulu with him, when he and some of his
      heelers started round the world; and I remember that papers were served on
      him in San Francisco. Mrs. Harman had made her application; it was just
      before he sailed. About a year and a half or two years later I met him
      again, in Paris. He was in pretty bad shape; seemed hypnotised by this
      Mariana and afraid as death of her; she could go into a tantrum that would
      frighten him into anything. It was a joke&mdash;down along the line of the
      all-night dancers and cafes&mdash;that she was going to marry him; and
      some one told me afterward that she claimed to have brought it about. I
      suppose it&rsquo;s true; but there is no question of his having married
      her in good faith. He believed that the divorce had been granted; he&rsquo;d
      offered no opposition to it whatever. He was travelling continually, and I
      don&rsquo;t think he knew much of what was going on, even right around
      him, most of the time. He began with cognac and absinthe in the morning,
      you know. For myself, I always supposed the suit had been carried through;
      so did people generally, I think. He&rsquo;ll probably have to stand
      trial, and of course he&rsquo;s technically guilty, but I don&rsquo;t
      believe he&rsquo;d be convicted&mdash;though I must say it would have been
      a most devilish good thing for him if he could have been got out of France
      before la Mursiana heard the truth. Then he could have made terms with her
      safely at a distance&mdash;she&rsquo;d have been powerless to injure him
      and would have precious soon come to time and been glad to take whatever
      he&rsquo;d give her. NOW, I suppose, that&rsquo;s impossible, and they&rsquo;ll
      arrest him if he tries to budge. But this talk of prison and all that is
      nonsense, my dear Elizabeth!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You admit there is a chance of it!&rdquo; she retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve said all I had to say,&rdquo; returned Mr. Ingle with a
      dubious laugh. &ldquo;And if you don&rsquo;t mind, I believe I&rsquo;ll
      wait for you outside, in the machine. I want to look at the gear-box.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, as if in deference to possible opposition, and, none being
      manifested, went hastily from the room with a sigh of relief, giving me,
      as he carefully closed the door, a glance of profound commiseration over
      his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Elizabeth had taken her brother&rsquo;s hand, not with the effect of
      clinging for sympathy; nor had her throwing her arms about him produced
      that effect; one could as easily have imagined Brunhilda hiding her face
      in a man&rsquo;s coat-lapels. George&rsquo;s sister wept, not weakly: she
      was on the defensive, but not for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does the fact that he may possibly escape going to prison&rdquo;&mdash;she
      addressed her cousin&mdash;&ldquo;make his position less scandalous, or
      can it make the man himself less detestable?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Harman looked at her steadily. There was a long and sorrowful pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing is changed,&rdquo; she said finally; her eyes still fixed
      gravely on Miss Elizabeth&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that, the other&rsquo;s face flamed up, and she uttered a half-choked
      exclamation. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she cried&mdash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve fallen
      in love with playing the martyr; it&rsquo;s SELF-love! You SEE yourself in
      the role! No one on earth could make me believe you&rsquo;re in LOVE with
      this degraded imbecile&mdash;all that&rsquo;s left of the wreck of a
      vicious life! It isn&rsquo;t that! It&rsquo;s because you want to make a
      shining example of yourself; you want to get down on your knees and wash
      off the vileness from this befouled creature; you want&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame!&rdquo; Keredec interrupted tremendously, &ldquo;you speak
      out of no knowledge!&rdquo; He leaned toward her across the table, which
      shook under the weight of his arms. &ldquo;There is no vileness; no one
      who is clean remains befouled because of the things that are gone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do not?&rdquo; She laughed hysterically, and for my part, I
      sighed in despair&mdash;for there was no stopping him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do not, indeed! Do you know the relation of TIME to this
      little life of ours? We have only the present moment; your consciousness
      of that is your existence. Your knowledge of each present moment as it
      passes&mdash;and it passes so swiftly that each word I speak now overlaps
      it&mdash;yet it is all we have. For all the rest, for what has gone by and
      what is yet coming&mdash;THAT has no real existence; it is all a dream. It
      is not ALIVE. It IS not! It IS&mdash;nothing! So the soul that stands
      clean and pure to-day IS clean and pure&mdash;and that is all there is to
      say about that soul!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a soul with evil tendencies,&rdquo; Ward began impatiently,
      &ldquo;if one must meet you on your own ground&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! my dear sir, those evil tendencies would be in the soiling
      memories, and my boy is free from them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He went toward all that was soiling before. Surely you can&rsquo;t
      pretend he may not take that direction again?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; returned the professor quickly, &ldquo;is his to
      choose. If this lady can be with him now, he will choose right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So!&rdquo; cried Miss Elizabeth, &ldquo;you offer her the role of a
      guide, do you? First she is to be his companion through a trial for bigamy
      in a French court, and, if he is acquitted, his nurse, teacher, and moral
      preceptor?&rdquo; She turned swiftly to her cousin. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      YOUR conception of a woman&rsquo;s mission?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any mission,&rdquo; Mrs. Harman answered quietly.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never thought about missions; I only know I belong to
      him; that&rsquo;s all I EVER thought about it. I don&rsquo;t pretend to
      explain it, or make it seem reasonable. And when I met him again, here, it
      was&mdash;it was&mdash;it was proved to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proved?&rdquo; echoed Miss Elizabeth incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; proved as certainly as the sun shining proves that it&rsquo;s
      day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you tell us?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was I who asked the question: I spoke involuntarily, but she did not
      seem to think it strange that I should ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, when I first met him,&rdquo; she said tremulously, &ldquo;I was
      frightened; but it was not he who frightened me&mdash;it was the rush of
      my own feeling. I did not know what I felt, but I thought I might die, and
      he was so like himself as I had first known him&mdash;but so changed, too;
      there was something so wonderful about him, something that must make any
      stranger feel sorry for him, and yet it is beautiful&mdash;&rdquo; She
      stopped for a moment and wiped her eyes, then went on bravely: &ldquo;And
      the next day he came, and waited for me&mdash;I should have come here for
      him if he hadn&rsquo;t&mdash;and I fell in with the mistake he had made
      about my name. You see, he&rsquo;d heard I was called &lsquo;Madame d&rsquo;Armand,&rsquo;
      and I wanted him to keep on thinking that, for I thought if he knew I was
      Mrs. Harman he might find out&mdash;&rdquo; She paused, her lip beginning
      to tremble. &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t you see why I didn&rsquo;t want him to
      know? I didn&rsquo;t want him to suffer as he would&mdash;as he does now,
      poor child!&mdash;but most of all I wanted&mdash;I wanted to see if he
      would fall in love with me again! I kept him from knowing, because, if he
      thought I was a stranger, and the same thing happened again&mdash;his
      caring for me, I mean&mdash;&rdquo; She had begun to weep now, freely and
      openly, but not from grief. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
      you SEE how it&rsquo;s all proven to me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see how it has deluded you!&rdquo; said Miss Elizabeth
      vehemently. &ldquo;I see what a rose-light it has thrown about this
      creature; but it won&rsquo;t last, thank God! any more than it did the
      other time. The thing is for you to come to your senses before&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my dear, I have come to them at last and for ever!&rdquo; The
      words rang full and strong, though she was white and shaking, and heavy
      tears filled her eyes. &ldquo;I know what I am doing now, if I never knew
      before!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never did know&mdash;&rdquo; Miss Ward began, but George
      stopped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elizabeth!&rdquo; he said quickly. &ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t go on
      like this; it&rsquo;s more than any of us can bear. Come, let&rsquo;s get
      out into the air; let&rsquo;s get back to Quesnay. We&rsquo;ll have Ingle
      drive us around the longer way, by the sea.&rdquo; He turned to his
      cousin. &ldquo;Louise, you&rsquo;ll come now? If not, we&rsquo;ll have to
      stay here with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; she answered, trying bravely to stop the
      tears that kept rising in spite of her; &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll wait till&rdquo;&mdash;and
      suddenly she flashed through them a smile so charming that my heart ached
      the harder for George&mdash;&ldquo;till I can stop crying!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Earl Percy and I sat opposite each other at dinner that evening.
      Perhaps, for charity&rsquo;s sake, I should add that though we faced each
      other, and, indeed, eyed each other solemnly at intervals, we partook not
      of the same repast, having each his own table; his being set in the garden
      at his constant station near the gallery steps, and mine, some fifty feet
      distant, upon my own veranda, but moved out from behind the honeysuckle
      screen, for I sat alone and the night was warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      To analyse my impression of Mr. Percy&rsquo;s glances, I cannot
      conscientiously record that I found favour in his eyes. For one thing, I
      fear he may not have recalled to his bosom a clarion sentiment (which
      doubtless he had ofttimes cheered from his native gallery in softer
      years): the honourable declaration that many an honest heart beats beneath
      a poor man&rsquo;s coat. As for his own attire, he was even as the lilies
      of Quesnay; that is to say, I beheld upon him the same formation of tie
      that I had seen there, the same sensuous beauty of the state waistcoat,
      though I think that his buttons were, if anything, somewhat spicier than
      those which had awed me at the chateau. And when we simultaneously reached
      the fragrant hour of coffee, the cigarette case that glittered in his hand
      was one for which some lady-friend of his (I knew intuitively) must have
      given her All&mdash;and then been left in debt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amedee had served us both; Glouglou, as aforetime, attending the silent
      &ldquo;Grande Suite,&rdquo; where the curtains were once more tightly
      drawn. Monsieur Rameau dined with his client in her own salon, evidently;
      at least, Victorine, the femme de chambre, passed to and from the kitchen
      in that direction, bearing laden trays. When Mr. Percy&rsquo;s cigarette
      had been lighted, hesitation marked the manner of our maitre d&rsquo;hotel;
      plainly he wavered, but finally old custom prevailed; abandoning the
      cigarette, he chose the cigar, and, hastily clearing my fashionable
      opponent&rsquo;s table, approached the pavilion with his most
      conversational face.
    </p>
    <p>
      I greeted him indifferently, but with hidden pleasure, for my soul (if
      Keredec is right and I have one) lay sorrowing. I needed relief, and
      whatever else Amedee was, he was always that. I spoke first:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amedee, how long a walk is it from Quesnay to Pere Baudry&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, about three-quarters of an hour for a good walker, one
      might say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A long way for Jean Ferret to go for a cup of cider,&rdquo; I
      remarked musingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? But why should he?&rdquo; asked Amedee blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why indeed? Surely even a Norman gardener lives for more than
      cider! You usually meet him there about noon, I believe?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Methought he had the grace to blush, though there is an everlasting doubt
      in my mind that it may have been the colour of the candle-shade producing
      that illusion. It was a strange thing to see, at all events, and, taking
      it for a physiological fact at the time, I let my willing eyes linger upon
      it as long as it (or its appearance) was upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were a little earlier than usual to-day,&rdquo; I continued
      finally, full of the marvel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur?&rdquo; He was wholly blank again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you there about eleven? Didn&rsquo;t you go about two
      hours after Mr. Ward and his friends left here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He scratched his head. &ldquo;I believe I had an errand in that direction.
      Eh? Yes, I remember. Truly, I think it so happened.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you found Jean Ferret there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where, monsieur?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Pere Baudry&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur.&rdquo; He was firm, somewhat reproachful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see Jean Ferret this morning?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amedee!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, but I did not find him at Pere Baudry&rsquo;s! It may have
      happened that I stopped there, but he did not come until some time after.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After you had gone away from Pere Baudry&rsquo;s, you mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur; after I arrived there. Truly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we have it! And you gave him the news of all that had happened
      here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A world&mdash;no, a constellation, a universe!&mdash;of reproach was in
      the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I retract the accusation,&rdquo; I said promptly. &ldquo;I meant
      something else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon everything that takes place at our hotel here, I am silent to
      all the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As the grave!&rdquo; I said with enthusiasm. &ldquo;Truly&mdash;that
      is a thing well known. But Jean Ferret, then? He is not so discreet; I
      have suspected that you are in his confidence. At times you have even
      hinted as much. Can you tell me if he saw the automobile of Monsieur Ingle
      when it came back to the chateau after leaving here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It had arrived the moment before he departed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite SO! I understand,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He related to me that Mademoiselle Ward had the appearance of
      agitation, and Madame d&rsquo;Armand that of pallor, which was also the
      case with Monsieur Ward.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Jean Ferret ran all the way to
      Pere Baudry&rsquo;s to learn from you the reason for this agitation and
      this pallor?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, monsieur&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I retract again!&rdquo; I cut him off&mdash;to save time. &ldquo;What
      other news had he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a gleam into his small, infolded eyes, a tiny glitter
      reflecting the mellow candle-light, but changing it, in that reflection,
      to a cold and sinister point of steel. It should have warned me, but, as
      he paused, I repeated my question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, people say everything,&rdquo; he answered, frowning as if
      deploring what they said in some secret, particular instance. &ldquo;The
      world is full of idle gossipers, tale-bearers, spreaders of scandal! And,
      though I speak with perfect respect, all the people at the chateau are not
      perfect in such ways.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean the domestics?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The visitors!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do they say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, well, then, they say&mdash;but no!&rdquo; He contrived a
      masterly pretense of pained reluctance. &ldquo;I cannot&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak out,&rdquo; I commanded, piqued by his shilly-shallying.
      &ldquo;What do they say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, it is about&rdquo;&mdash;he shifted his weight from one
      leg to the other&mdash;&ldquo;it is about&mdash;about that beautiful
      Mademoiselle Elliott who sometimes comes here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was so far from what I had expected that I was surprised into a
      slight change of attitude, which all too plainly gratified him, though he
      made an effort to conceal it. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said uneasily, &ldquo;what
      do they find to say of Mademoiselle Elliott?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say that her painting is only a ruse to see monsieur.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see Monsieur Saffren, yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, no!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;That is not&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is,&rdquo; I assured him calmly. &ldquo;As you know,
      Monsieur Saffren is very, very handsome, and Mademoiselle Elliott, being a
      painter, is naturally anxious to look at him from time to time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are sure?&rdquo; he said wistfully, even plaintively. &ldquo;That
      is not the meaning Jean Ferret put upon it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was mistaken.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be, it may be,&rdquo; he returned, greatly crestfallen,
      picking up his tray and preparing to go. &ldquo;But Jean Ferret was very
      positive.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am even more so!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then that malicious maid of Mademoiselle Ward&rsquo;s was mistaken
      also,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;when she said that now a marriage is to
      take place between Mademoiselle Ward and Monsieur Ingle&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proceed,&rdquo; I bade him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved a few feet nearer the kitchen. &ldquo;The malicious woman said to
      Jean Ferret&mdash;&rdquo; He paused and coughed. &ldquo;It was in
      reference to those Italian jewels monsieur used to send&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about them?&rdquo; I asked ominously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The woman says that Mademoiselle Ward&mdash;&rdquo; he increased
      the distance between us&mdash;&ldquo;that now she should give them to
      Mademoiselle Elliott! GOOD night, monsieur!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His entrance into the kitchen was precipitate. I sank down again into the
      wicker chair (from which I had hastily risen) and contemplated the stars.
      But the short reverie into which I then fell was interrupted by Mr. Percy,
      who, sauntering leisurely about the garden, paused to address me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You folks thinks you was all to the gud, gittin&rsquo; them trunks
      off, what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak in mysterious numbers,&rdquo; I returned, having no
      comprehension of his meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you don&rsquo; know nothin&rsquo; about it,&rdquo; he
      laughed satirically. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo; go over to Lisieux &lsquo;saft&rsquo;noon
      to ship &lsquo;em? Oh, no, not YOU!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went for a long walk this afternoon, Mr. Percy. Naturally, I
      couldn&rsquo;t have walked so far as Lisieux and back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luk here, m&rsquo;friend,&rdquo; he said sharply&mdash;&ldquo;I
      reco&rsquo;nise &lsquo;at you&rsquo;re tryin&rsquo; t&rsquo; play your own
      hand, but I ast you as man to man: DO you think you got any chanst t&rsquo;
      git that feller off t&rsquo; Paris?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DO you think it will rain to-night?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light of a reflecting lamp which hung on the wall near the archway
      enabled me to perceive a bitter frown upon his forehead. &ldquo;When a gen&rsquo;leman
      asts a question AS a gen&rsquo;leman,&rdquo; he said, his voice expressing
      a noble pathos, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see no call for no other gen&rsquo;leman
      to go an&rsquo; play the smart Aleck and not answer him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In simple dignity he turned his back upon me and strolled to the other end
      of the courtyard, leaving me to the renewal of my reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a happy one. My friends&mdash;old and new&mdash;I saw
      inextricably caught in a tangle of cross-purposes, miserably and
      hopelessly involved in a situation for which I could predict no possible
      relief. I was able to understand now the beauty as well as the madness of
      Keredec&rsquo;s plan; and I had told him so (after the departure of the
      Quesnay party), asking his pardon for my brusquerie of the morning. But
      the towering edifice his hopes had erected was now tumbled about his ears:
      he had failed to elude the Mursiana. There could be no doubt of her
      absolute control of the situation. THAT was evident in the every step of
      the youth now confidently parading before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following his active stride with my eye, I observed him in the act of
      saluting, with a gracious nod of his bare head, some one, invisible to me,
      who was approaching from the road. Immediately after&mdash;and altogether
      with the air of a person merely &ldquo;happening in&rdquo;&mdash;a slight
      figure, clad in a long coat, a short skirt, and a broad-brimmed,
      veil-bound brown hat, sauntered casually through the archway and came into
      full view in the light of the reflector.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sprang to my feet and started toward her, uttering an exclamation which
      I was unable to stifle, though I tried to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening, Mr. Percy,&rdquo; she said cheerily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      the most EXUBERANT night. YOU&rsquo;RE quite hearty, I hope?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Takin&rsquo; a walk, I see, little lady,&rdquo; he observed with
      genial patronage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not just for that,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more
      to see HIM.&rdquo; She nodded to me, and, as I reached her, carelessly
      gave me her left hand. &ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m studying with him,&rdquo;
      she continued to Mr. Percy, exhibiting a sketch-book under her arm.
      &ldquo;I dropped over to get a criticism.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, drawin&rsquo;-lessons?&rdquo; said Mr. Percy tolerantly.
      &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo; lemme interrup&rsquo; ye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved as if to withdraw toward the steps, but she detained him with a
      question. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re spending the rest of the summer here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; he answered tersely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear you have some PASSIONATELY interesting friends.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you hear that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; she responded commiseratingly.
      &ldquo;This is the most scandalously gossipy neighbourhood in France. My
      DEAR young man, every one from here to Timbuctu knows all about it by this
      time!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All about what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the excitement you&rsquo;re such a VALUABLE part of; about
      your wonderful Spanish friend and how she claims the strange young man
      here for her husband.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll know more&rsquo;n that, I expec&rsquo;,&rdquo; he
      returned with a side glance at me, &ldquo;before VERY long.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one thinks <i>I</i> am so interesting,&rdquo; she rattled on
      artlessly, &ldquo;because I happened to meet YOU in the woods. I&rsquo;ve
      held quite a levee all day. In a reflected way it makes a heroine of me,
      you see, because you are one of the very MOST prominent figures in it all.
      I hope you won&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve been too bold,&rdquo; she pursued
      anxiously, &ldquo;in claiming that I really am one of your acquaintances?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; he politely assured her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad.&rdquo; Her laughter rang out gaily. &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve
      been talking about you as if we were the OLDEST friends, and I&rsquo;d
      hate to have them find me out. I&rsquo;ve told them everything&mdash;about
      your appearance you see, and how your hair was parted, and how you were
      dressed, and&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luk here,&rdquo; he interrupted, suddenly discharging his Bowery
      laugh, &ldquo;did you tell &lsquo;em how HE was dressed?&rdquo; He pointed
      a jocular finger at me. &ldquo;That WUD &lsquo;a&rsquo; made a hit!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; we weren&rsquo;t talking of him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? He&rsquo;s in it, too. Bullieve me, he THINKS he is!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the excitement, you mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right!&rdquo; said Mr. Percy amiably. &ldquo;He goes round holdin&rsquo;
      Rip Van Winkle Keredec&rsquo;s hand when the ole man&rsquo;s cryin&rsquo;;
      helpin&rsquo; him sneak his trunks off t&rsquo; Paris&mdash;playin&rsquo;
      the hired man gener&rsquo;ly. Oh, he thinks he&rsquo;s quite the boy, in
      this trouble!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s a small part,&rdquo; she returned,
      &ldquo;compared to yours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I hold my end up, I guess.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think you&rsquo;d be so worn out and sleepy you couldn&rsquo;t
      hold your head up!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? ME? Not t&rsquo;-night, m&rsquo;little friend. I tuk MY sleep&rsquo;s
      aft&rsquo;noon and let Rameau do the Sherlock a little while.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She gazed upon him with unconcealed admiration. &ldquo;You are wonderful,&rdquo;
      she sighed faintly, and &ldquo;WONDERFUL!&rdquo; she breathed again.
      &ldquo;How prosaic are drawing-lessons,&rdquo; she continued, touching my
      arm and moving with me toward the pavilion, &ldquo;after listening to a
      man of action like that!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy, establishing himself comfortably in a garden chair at the foot
      of the gallery steps, was heard to utter a short cough as he renewed the
      light of his cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      My visitor paused upon my veranda, humming, &ldquo;Quand l&rsquo;Amour
      Meurt&rdquo; while I went within and lit a lamp. &ldquo;Shall I bring the
      light out there?&rdquo; I asked, but, turning, found that she was already
      in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sketch-book is my duenna,&rdquo; she said, sinking into a chair
      upon one side of the centre table, upon which I placed the lamp. &ldquo;Lessons
      are unquestionable, at any place or time. Behold the beautiful posies!&rdquo;
      She spread the book open on the table between us, as I seated myself
      opposite her, revealing some antique coloured smudges of flowers. &ldquo;Elegancies
      of Eighteen-Forty! Isn&rsquo;t that a survival of the period when young
      ladies had &lsquo;accomplishments,&rsquo; though! I found it at the
      chateau and&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that you can&rsquo;t
      ramble over the country alone at this time of night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you speak any louder,&rdquo; she said, with some urgency of
      manner, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be &lsquo;hopelessly compromised socially,&rsquo;
      as Mrs. Alderman McGinnis and the Duchess of Gwythyl-Corners say&rdquo;&mdash;she
      directed my glance, by one of her own, through the open door to Mr. Percy&mdash;&ldquo;because
      HE&rsquo;LL hear you and know that the sketch-book was only a shallow
      pretext of mine to see you. Do be a little manfully self-contained, or you&rsquo;ll
      get us talked about! And as for &lsquo;this time of night,&rsquo; I
      believe it&rsquo;s almost half past nine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Miss Ward know&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it likely? One of the most convenient things about a
      chateau is the number of ways to get out of it without being seen. I had a
      choice of eight. So I &lsquo;suffered fearfully from neuralgia,&rsquo;
      dined in my own room, and sped through the woods to my honest forester.&rdquo;
      She nodded brightly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s YOU!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t afraid to come through the woods alone?&rdquo; I
      asked, uncomfortably conscious that her gaiety met a dull response from
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if Miss Ward finds that you&rsquo;re not at the chateau&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t; she thinks I&rsquo;m asleep. She brought me up a
      sleeping-powder herself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She thinks you took it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She KNOWS I did,&rdquo; said Miss Elliott. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m full of
      it! And that will be the reason&mdash;if you notice that I&rsquo;m
      particularly nervous or excited.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem all of that,&rdquo; I said, looking at her eyes, which
      were very wide and very brilliant. &ldquo;However, I believe you always
      do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;I knew you thought me atrocious from
      the first. You find MYRIADS of objections to me, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I had forgotten to look away from her eyes, and I kept on forgetting. (The
      same thing had happened several times lately; and each time, by a somewhat
      painful coincidence, I remembered my age at precisely the instant I
      remembered to look away.) &ldquo;Dazzling&rdquo; is a good old-fashioned
      word for eyes like hers; at least it might define their effect on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I did manage to object to you,&rdquo; I said slowly, &ldquo;it
      would be a good thing for me&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve WON!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won?&rdquo; I echoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I laid a wager with myself that I&rsquo;d have a pretty speech
      from you before I went out of your life&rdquo;&mdash;she checked a laugh,
      and concluded thrillingly&mdash;&ldquo;forever! I leave Quesnay to-morrow!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father has returned from America?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear, no,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be quite at the
      world&rsquo;s mercy. I must go up to Paris and retire from public life
      until he does come. I shall take the vows&mdash;in some obscure but
      respectable pension.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t endure the life at the chateau any longer?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t endure ME any longer. If I shouldn&rsquo;t go
      to-morrow I&rsquo;d be put out, I think&mdash;after to-night!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you intimated that no one would know about to-night!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The night isn&rsquo;t over yet,&rdquo; she replied enigmatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It almost is&mdash;for you,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;because in ten
      minutes I shall take you back to the chateau gates.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She offered no comment on this prophecy, but gazed at me thoughtfully and
      seriously for several moments. &ldquo;I suppose you can imagine,&rdquo;
      she said, in a tone that threatened to become tremulous, &ldquo;what sort
      of an afternoon we&rsquo;ve been having up there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has it been&mdash;&rdquo; I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, heart-breaking! Louise came to my room as soon as they got back
      from here, this morning, and told me the whole pitiful story. But they
      didn&rsquo;t let her stay there long, poor woman!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Elizabeth and her brother. They&rsquo;ve been at her all
      afternoon&mdash;off and on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To do what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To &lsquo;save herself,&rsquo; so they call it. They&rsquo;re
      insisting that she must not see her poor husband again. They&rsquo;re
      DETERMINED she sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But George wouldn&rsquo;t worry her,&rdquo; I objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, wouldn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; The girl laughed sadly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      suppose he could help it, he&rsquo;s in such a state himself, but between
      him and Elizabeth it&rsquo;s hard to see how poor Mrs. Harman lived
      through the day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said slowly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that they&rsquo;re
      not right. She ought to be kept out of all this as much as possible; and
      if her husband has to go through a trial&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to tell me something,&rdquo; Miss Elliott interrupted.
      &ldquo;How much do you like Mr. Ward?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an old friend. I suppose I like my old friends in about
      the same way that other people like theirs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much do you like Mr. Saffren&mdash;I mean Mr. Harman?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, THAT!&rdquo; I groaned. &ldquo;If I could still call him
      &lsquo;Oliver Saffren,&rsquo; if I could still think of him as &lsquo;Oliver
      Saffren,&rsquo; it would be easy to answer. I never was so &lsquo;drawn&rsquo;
      to a man in my life before. But when I think of him as Larrabee Harman, I
      am full of misgivings.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Louise isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she put in eagerly, and with something
      oddly like the manner of argument. &ldquo;His wife isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know. Perhaps one reason is that she never saw him at quite
      his worst. I did. I had only two glimpses of him&mdash;of the briefest&mdash;but
      they inspired me with such a depth of dislike that I can&rsquo;t tell you
      how painful it was to discover that &lsquo;Oliver Saffren&rsquo;&mdash;this
      strange, pathetic, attractive FRIEND of mine&mdash;is the same man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but he isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she exclaimed quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keredec says he is,&rdquo; I laughed helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So does Louise,&rdquo; returned Miss Elliott, disdaining
      consistency in her eagerness. &ldquo;And she&rsquo;s right&mdash;and she
      cares more for him than she ever did!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose she does.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you&mdash;&rdquo; the girl began, then stopped for a moment,
      looking at me steadily. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you a little in love with her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered honestly. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;THAT&rsquo;S what I wanted to know!&rdquo; she said; and as she
      turned a page in the sketch-book for the benefit of Mr. Percy, I saw that
      her hand had begun to tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I asked, leaning toward her across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, if she were involved in some undertaking&mdash;something
      that, if it went wrong, would endanger her happiness and, I think, even
      her life&mdash;for it might actually kill her if she failed, and brought
      on a worse catastrophe&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; I said anxiously, as she paused again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d help her?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would indeed,&rdquo; I assented earnestly. &ldquo;I told her once
      I&rsquo;d do anything in the world for her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even if it involved something that George Ward might never forgive
      you for?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said, &lsquo;anything in the world,&rsquo;&rdquo; I returned,
      perhaps a little huskily. &ldquo;I meant all of that. If there is anything
      she wants me to do, I shall do it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a low cry of triumph, but immediately checked it. Then she leaned
      far over the table, her face close above the book, and, tracing the
      outline of an uncertain lily with her small, brown-gloved forefinger, as
      though she were consulting me on the drawing, &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t afraid
      to come through the woods alone,&rdquo; she said, in a very low voice,
      &ldquo;because I wasn&rsquo;t alone. Louise came with me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; I gasped. &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the Baudry cottage down the road. They won&rsquo;t miss her at
      the chateau until morning; I locked her door on the outside, and if they
      go to bother her again&mdash;though I don&rsquo;t think they will&mdash;they&rsquo;ll
      believe she&rsquo;s fastened it on the inside and is asleep. She managed
      to get a note to Keredec late this afternoon; it explained everything, and
      he had some trunks carried out the rear gate of the inn and carted over to
      Lisieux to be shipped to Paris from there. It is to be supposed&mdash;or
      hoped, at least&mdash;that this woman and her people will believe THAT
      means Professor Keredec and Mr. Harman will try to get to Paris in the
      same way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what Percy meant about the
      trunks. I didn&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s on watch, you see,&rdquo; she continued, turning a page
      to another drawing. &ldquo;He means to sit up all night, or he wouldn&rsquo;t
      have slept this afternoon. He&rsquo;s not precisely the kind to be in the
      habit of afternoon naps&mdash;Mr. Percy!&rdquo; She laughed nervously.
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s almost absolutely necessary for us to
      have you. If we have&mdash;the thing is so simple that it&rsquo;s certain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have me for what?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll help&rdquo;&mdash;and, as she looked up, her eyes,
      now very close to mine, were dazzling indeed&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll adore
      you for ever and ever! Oh, MUCH longer than you&rsquo;d like me to!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean she&rsquo;s going to&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that she&rsquo;s going to run away with him again,&rdquo;
      she whispered.

      CHAPTER XXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      At midnight there was no mistaking the palpable uneasiness with which Mr.
      Percy, faithful sentry, regarded the behaviour of Miss Elliott and myself
      as we sat conversing upon the veranda of the pavilion. It was not fear for
      the security of his prisoner which troubled him, but the unseemliness of
      the young woman&rsquo;s persistence in remaining to this hour under an
      espionage no more matronly than that of a sketch-book abandoned on the
      table when we had come out to the open. The youth had veiled his
      splendours with more splendour: a long overcoat of so glorious a plaid it
      paled the planets above us; and he wandered restlessly about the garden in
      this refulgence, glancing at us now and then with what, in spite of the
      insufficient revelation of the starlight, we both recognised as a chilling
      disapproval. The lights of the inn were all out; the courtyard was dark.
      The Spanish woman and Monsieur Rameau had made their appearance for a
      moment, half an hour earlier, to exchange a word with their fellow
      vigilant, and, soon after, the extinguishing of the lamps in their
      respective apartments denoted their retirement for the night. In the
      &ldquo;Grande Suite&rdquo; all had been dark and silent for an hour. About
      the whole place the only sign of life, aside from those signs furnished by
      our three selves, was a rhythmical sound from an open window near the
      kitchen, where incontrovertibly slumbered our maitre d&rsquo;hotel after
      the cares of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the occasion of our forest meeting Mr. Percy had signified his desire
      to hear some talk of Art. I think he had his fill to-night&mdash;and more;
      for that was the subject chosen by my dashing companion, and vivaciously
      exploited until our awaited hour was at hand. Heaven knows what nonsense I
      prattled, I do not; I do not think I knew at the time. I talked
      mechanically, trying hard not to betray my increasing excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under cover of this traduction of the Muse I served, I kept going over and
      over the details of Louise Harman&rsquo;s plan, as the girl beside me had
      outlined it, bending above the smudgy sketch-book. &ldquo;To make them
      think the flight is for Paris,&rdquo; she had urged, &ldquo;to Paris by
      way of Lisieux. To make that man yonder believe that it is toward Lisieux,
      while they turn at the crossroads, and drive across the country to
      Trouville for the morning boat to Havre.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was simple; that was its great virtue. If they were well started, they
      were safe; and well started meant only that Larrabee Harman should leave
      the inn without an alarm, for an alarm sounded too soon meant &ldquo;racing
      and chasing on Canoby Lea,&rdquo; before they could get out of the
      immediate neighbourhood. But with two hours&rsquo; start, and the pursuit
      spending most of its energy in the wrong direction&mdash;that is, toward
      Lisieux and Paris&mdash;they would be on the deck of the French-Canadian
      liner to-morrow noon, sailing out of the harbour of Le Havre, with nothing
      but the Atlantic Ocean between them and the St. Lawrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought of the woman who dared this flight for her lover, of the woman
      who came full-armed between him and the world, a Valkyr winging down to
      bear him away to a heaven she would make for him herself. Gentle as she
      was, there must have been a Valkyr in her somewhere, or she could not
      attempt this. She swept in, not only between him and the world, but
      between him and the destroying demons his own sins had raised to beset
      him. There, I thought, was a whole love; or there she was not only wife
      but mother to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I remembered the dream of her I had before I ever saw her, on that
      first night after I came down to Normandy, when Amedee&rsquo;s talk of
      &ldquo;Madame d&rsquo;Armand&rdquo; had brought her into my thoughts. I
      remembered that I had dreamed of finding her statue, but it was veiled and
      I could not uncover it. And to-night it seemed to me that the veil had
      lifted, and the statue was a figure of Mercy in the beautiful likeness of
      Louise Harman. Then Keredec was wrong, optimist as he was, since a will
      such as hers could save him she loved, even from his own acts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when you come to Monticelli&rsquo;s first style&mdash;&rdquo;
      Miss Elliott&rsquo;s voice rose a little, and I caught the sound of a new
      thrill vibrating in it&mdash;&ldquo;you find a hundred others of his epoch
      doing it quite as well, not a BIT of a bit less commonplace&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She broke off suddenly, and looking up, as I had fifty times in the last
      twenty minutes, I saw that a light shone from Keredec&rsquo;s window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say they ARE commonplace,&rdquo; I remarked, rising. &ldquo;But
      now, if you will permit me, I&rsquo;ll offer you my escort back to
      Quesnay.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I went into my room, put on my cap, lit a lantern, and returned with it to
      the veranda. &ldquo;If you are ready?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, quite,&rdquo; she answered, and we crossed the garden as far as
      the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy signified his approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gunna see the little lady home, are you?&rdquo; he said graciously.
      &ldquo;I was THINKIN&rsquo; it was about time, m&rsquo;self!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The salon door of the &ldquo;Grand Suite&rdquo; opened, above me, and at
      the sound, the youth started, springing back to see what it portended, but
      I ran quickly up the steps. Keredec stood in the doorway, bare-headed and
      in his shirt-sleeves; in one hand he held a travelling-bag, which he
      immediately gave me, setting his other for a second upon my shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, my good, good friend,&rdquo; he said with an emotion in
      his big voice which made me glad of what I was doing. He went back into
      the room, closing the door, and I descended the steps as rapidly as I had
      run up them. Without pausing, I started for the rear of the courtyard,
      Miss Elliott accompanying me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sentry had watched these proceedings open-mouthed, more mystified than
      alarmed. &ldquo;Luk here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I want t&rsquo; know whut
      this means.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything you choose to think it means,&rdquo; I laughed, beginning
      to walk a little more rapidly. He glanced up at the windows of the &ldquo;Grande
      Suite,&rdquo; which were again dark, and began to follow us slowly.
      &ldquo;What you gut in that grip?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re carrying off Mr. Harman?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon HE&rsquo;S in his room all right,&rdquo; said the youth
      grimly; &ldquo;unless he&rsquo;s FLEW out. But I want t&rsquo; know what
      you think y&rsquo;re doin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just now,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m opening this door.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a fact he could not question. We emerged at the foot of a lane
      behind the inn; it was long and narrow, bordered by stone walls, and at
      the other end debouched upon a road which passed the rear of the Baudry
      cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Elliott took my arm, and we entered the lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy paused undecidedly. &ldquo;I want t&rsquo; know whut you think y&rsquo;re
      doin&rsquo;?&rdquo; he repeated angrily, calling after us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very simple,&rdquo; I called in turn. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
      I do an errand for a friend? Can&rsquo;t I even carry his travelling-bag
      for him, without going into explanations to everybody I happen to meet?
      And,&rdquo; I added, permitting some anxiety to be marked in my voice,
      &ldquo;I think you may as well go back. We&rsquo;re not going far enough
      to need a guard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy allowed an oath to escape him, and we heard him muttering to
      himself. Then his foot-steps sounded behind us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo; Miss Elliott whispered, with nervous
      exultation, looking over her shoulder. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to follow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was sure to,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      We trudged briskly on, followed at some fifty paces by the perturbed
      watchman. Presently I heard my companion utter a sigh so profound that it
      was a whispered moan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s the thought of Quesnay and to-morrow; facing them
      with THIS!&rdquo; she quavered. &ldquo;Louise has written a letter for me
      to give them, but I&rsquo;ll have to tell them&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not alone,&rdquo; I whispered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there when you
      come down from your room in the morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We were embarked upon a singular adventure, not unattended by a certain
      danger; we were tingling with a hundred apprehensions, occupied with the
      vital necessity of drawing the little spy after us&mdash;and that was a
      strange moment for a man (and an elderly painter-man of no mark, at that!)
      to hear himself called what I was called then, in a tremulous whisper
      close to my ear. Of course she has denied it since; nevertheless, she said
      it&mdash;twice, for I pretended not to hear her the first time. I made no
      answer, for something in the word she called me, and in her seeming to
      mean it, made me choke up so that I could not even whisper; but I made up
      my mind that, after THAT if this girl saw Mr. Earl Percy on his way back
      to the inn before she wished him to go, it would be because he had killed
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were near the end of the lane when the neigh of a horse sounded
      sonorously from the road beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percy came running up swiftly and darted by us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he called loudly. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that
      in the cart yonder?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I set my lantern on the ground close to the wall, and at the same moment a
      horse and cart drew up on the road at the end of the lane, showing against
      the starlight. It was Pere Baudry&rsquo;s best horse, a stout gray, that
      would easily enough make Trouville by daylight. A woman&rsquo;s figure and
      a man&rsquo;s (the latter that of Pere Baudry himself) could be made out
      dimly on the seat of the cart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it, I say?&rdquo; shouted our excited friend. &ldquo;What
      kind of a game d&rsquo;ye think y&rsquo;re puttin&rsquo; up on me here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He set his hand on the side of the cart and sprang upon the hub of the
      wheel. A glance at the occupants satisfied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Harman!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;Mrs. Harman!&rdquo; He leaped
      down into the road. &ldquo;I knowed I was a fool to come away without
      wakin&rsquo; up Rameau. But you haven&rsquo;t beat us yet!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He drove back into the lane, but just inside its entrance I met him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back to the pigeon-house in a hurry. There&rsquo;s devilment here,
      and I want Rameau. Git out o&rsquo; my way!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going back,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hell I ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Mr. Percy. &ldquo;I give ye two
      seconds t&rsquo; git out o&rsquo; my&mdash;TAKE YER HANDS OFFA ME!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I made sure of my grip, not upon the refulgent overcoat, for I feared he
      might slip out of that, but upon the collars of his coat and waistcoat,
      which I clenched together in my right hand. I knew that he was quick, and
      I suspected that he was &ldquo;scientific,&rdquo; but I did it before he
      had finished talking, and so made fast, with my mind and heart and soul
      set upon sticking to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      My suspicions as to his &ldquo;science&rdquo; were perfervidly justified.
      &ldquo;You long-legged devil!&rdquo; he yelled, and I instantly received a
      series of concussions upon the face and head which put me in supreme doubt
      of my surroundings, for I seemed to have plunged, eyes foremost, into the
      Milky Way. But I had my left arm around his neck, which probably saved me
      from a coup de grace, as he was forced to pommel me at half-length. Pommel
      it was; to use so gentle a word for what to me was crash, bang, smash,
      battle, murder, earthquake and tornado. I was conscious of some one
      screaming, and it seemed a consoling part of my delirium that the cheek of
      Miss Anne Elliott should be jammed tight against mine through one phase of
      the explosion. My arms were wrenched, my fingers twisted and tortured,
      and, when it was all too clear to me that I could not possibly bear one
      added iota of physical pain, the ingenious fiend began to kick my shins
      and knees with feet like crowbars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conflict of any sort was never my vocation. I had not been an
      accessory-during-the-fact to a fight since I passed the truculent age of
      fourteen; and it is a marvel that I was able to hang to that dynamic
      bundle of trained muscles&mdash;which defines Mr. Earl Percy well enough&mdash;for
      more than ten seconds. Yet I did hang to him, as Pere Baudry testifies,
      for a minute and a half, which seems no inconsiderable lapse of time to a
      person undergoing such experiences as were then afflicting me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared to me that we were revolving in enormous circles in the ether,
      and I had long since given my last gasp, when there came a great roaring
      wind in my ears and a range of mountains toppled upon us both; we went to
      earth beneath it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! you must create violence, then?&rdquo; roared the avalanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the voice was the voice of Keredec.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one pulled me from underneath my struggling antagonist, and, the
      power of sight in a hazy, zigzagging fashion coming back to me, I
      perceived the figure of Miss Anne Elliott recumbent beside me, her arms
      about Mr. Percy&rsquo;s prostrate body. The extraordinary girl had
      fastened upon him, too, though I had not known it, and she had gone to
      ground with us; but it is to be said for Mr. Earl Percy that no blow of
      his touched her, and she was not hurt. Even in the final extremities of
      temper, he had carefully discriminated in my favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Harman was bending over her, and, as the girl sprang up lightly,
      threw her arms about her. For my part, I rose more slowly, section by
      section, wondering why I did not fall apart; lips, nose, and cheeks
      bleeding, and I had a fear that I should need to be led like a blind man,
      through my eyelids swelling shut. That was something I earnestly desired
      should not happen; but whether it did, or did not&mdash;or if the heavens
      fell!&mdash;I meant to walk back to Quesnay with Anne Elliott that night,
      and, mangled, broken, or half-dead, presenting whatever appearance of the
      prize-ring or the abattoir that I might, I intended to take the same train
      for Paris on the morrow that she did.
    </p>
    <p>
      For our days together were not at an end; nor was it hers nor my desire
      that they should be.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was Oliver Saffren&mdash;as I like to think of him&mdash;who helped me
      to my feet and wiped my face with his handkerchief, and when that one was
      ruined, brought others from his bag and stanched the wounds gladly
      received, in the service of his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will remember&mdash;&rdquo; he said, and his voice broke. &ldquo;These
      are the memories which Keredec says make a man good. I pray they will help
      to redeem me.&rdquo; And for the last time I heard the child in him
      speaking: &ldquo;I ought to be redeemed; I must be, don&rsquo;t you think,
      for her sake?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lose no time!&rdquo; shouted Keredec. &ldquo;You must be gone if
      you will reach that certain town for the five-o&rsquo;clock train of the
      morning.&rdquo; This was for the spy&rsquo;s benefit; it indicated Lisieux
      and the train to Paris. Mr. Percy struggled; the professor knelt over him,
      pinioning his wrists in one great hand, and holding him easily to earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! my friend&mdash;&rdquo; he addressed his captive&mdash;&ldquo;you
      shall not have cause to say we do you any harm; there shall be no law, for
      you are not hurt, and you are not going to be. But here you shall stay
      quiet for a little while&mdash;till I say you can go.&rdquo; As he spoke
      he bound the other&rsquo;s wrists with a short rope which he took from his
      pocket, performing the same office immediately afterward for Mr. Percy&rsquo;s
      ankles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take the count!&rdquo; was the sole remark of that philosopher.
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go up against no herd of elephants.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said the professor, rising, &ldquo;good-bye! The
      sun shall rise gloriously for you tomorrow. Come, it is time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The two women were crying in each other&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo;
      sobbed Anne Elliott.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Harman turned to Keredec. &ldquo;Good-bye! for a little while.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her hand. &ldquo;Dear lady, I shall come within the year.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She came to me, and I took her hand, meaning to kiss it as Keredec had
      done, but suddenly she was closer and I felt her lips upon my battered
      cheek. I remember it now.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrung her husband&rsquo;s hand, and then he took her in his arms, lifted
      her to the foot-board of the cart, and sprang up beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you, and good-bye!&rdquo; we called.
    </p>
    <p>
      And their voices came back to us. &ldquo;God bless YOU and good-bye!&rdquo;
      They were carried into the enveloping night. We stared after them down the
      road; watching the lantern on the tail-board of the cart diminish;
      watching it dim and dwindle to a point of gray;&mdash;listening until the
      hoof-beats of the heavy Norman grew fainter than the rustle of the branch
      that rose above the wall beside us. But it is bad luck to strain eyes and
      ears to the very last when friends are parting, because that so sharpens
      the loneliness; and before the cart went quite beyond our ken, two of us
      set out upon the longest way to Quesnay.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
